DESCRIPTION:Modern research computing needs at academic institutions are e
 volving. While traditional HPC satisfies most workflows\, researchers seek
  sophisticated\, on-demand\, and self-service control of compute infrastru
 cture. Furthermore\, many also seek policy-compliant safe spaces to comput
 e on sensitive or protected data.\nTo cater to these users\, the Minnesota
  Supercomputing Institute deployed an OpenStack cloud called Stratus. In c
 ontrast to typical clouds\, Stratus does not manage internal infrastructur
 e\; rather\, Stratus complements bare-metal\, fully-managed HPC\, with a s
 elf-service model that can accommodate non-traditional computational and s
 torage needs with HPC-like performance.  \nThis talk describes the lessons
  learned in launching a platform to support research with specific data-us
 e agreements\; and also issues concerning accountability\, risk acceptance
 \, and the role of project leadership when a large supercomputing facility
  deviates from its traditional base of support.

DESCRIPTION:Networking a Bare Metal cloud (using Ironic server deployments
 ) is more than just slapping VLANs on switch ports. If you need scale\, yo
 u need VXLAN &ndash\; even for bare metal cloud. \n \nHow does this mesh w
 ith pure software-based VXLAN deployments?\n \nThe latest SDN revolution i
 s centered on creating efficient virtualized data center networks using VX
 LAN & EVPN.  We will talk about the scale\, performance\, and cost advanta
 ges of using a modern controller-free virtualized network built on 100 Gig
 abit Ethernet switches with hardware based VXLAN Routing.   \nWe will expl
 ore how to automate such a network in an OpenStack environment and take yo
 u through a real world use case of using OpenStack Network Node bridging b
 etween a bare metal cloud (EVPN) and a fully virtualized cloud environment
 s (orchestrated by Neutron).

DESCRIPTION:CERN\, the European Organization for Nuclear Research\, is run
 ning for several years a large OpenStack Cloud that helps thousands of sci
 entists to analyze the data from the LHC.\nIn 2012\, early in the design p
 hase of the CERN Cloud we decided to use Nova Cells to enable the infrastr
 ucture to scale to thousands of nodes. Now with more than 280K cores sprea
 d across 70 cells that are hosted in two data centres we were faced with t
 he challenge to migrate to Nova Cells V2 required in the Pike release.\nIn
  this presentation\, we will describe how Nova Cells allowed CERN to scale
  to thousands of nodes\, its advantages and how we mitigate the implementa
 tion issues of Nova Cells V1. Next\, we will cover how we upgraded Nova fr
 om Newton with Cells V1 to Pike with Cells V2. We will explain the steps t
 hat we followed and the issues that we faced during the upgrade. Finally\,
  we will report our experience with Cells V2 at scale\, its caveats and ho
 w we are mitigate them.

 about these challenges and how they tackled them internally. Uber also Ope
 n-sourced code that handles the case where a certificate expires or is rev
 oked after login.SSH certificates part of the solution\, but management co
 mplexity persists. At Huawei\, we proposed and are leading Tatu: an Open S
 ource project that makes SSH management for Cloud environments effortless 
 and secure.Tatu provides: CA capabilities\; automatic installation of host
  certificates in servers\; user SSH certificates\; expiry and revocation o

DESCRIPTION:In LINE we operate massive scale messaging service with 200+ m
 illion active users\, where fair share of the service components are being
  hosted on our 2 private OpenStack-based clouds that are currently in a 50
 .000+ cores scale range\, and growing rapidly.\nAs our cloud expanded into
  new regions\, in order to achieve better scalability\, we had established
  a CLOS type network underlay all the way from top level fabric routers to
  the hypervisor itself\, while keeping our cloud architecture fairly simpl
 e.\n In this new architecture\, the Hypervisor would exchange routes to it
 s VMs with ToR switches\, thus providing the VMs with the external L3 conn
 ectivity and completely isolating L2 traffic between instances\, on hyperv
 isor and cloud level. Neutron currently does not support such use-case\, s
 o we had implemented a custom plugin and agent to make it possible. \nIn t
 his session we will explain how we had implemented such solution in Neutro
 n.

  to an edge-optimized architecture\, we can help textile industry improve 
 fabric quality\, reduce operation cost and increase production efficiency.
  In this session\, I’ll share:\nWhat’s edge computing and why it’s i
 mportant to intelligence manufacturing\nWhat’s the characteristics\, str
 engths and weaknesses of traditional fabric defect detection method\nWhy t
 extile industry can benefit from edge computing infrastructure \nHow to de

DESCRIPTION:In 2014\, Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Toronto\, C
 anada started building the Cancer Genome Collaboratory\, an OpenStack envi
 ronment designed for large scale cancerresearch projects. The cloud provid
 ing 2600 cores and 7.3 PB of object storage is now home to 90 users and 35
  research projects from four continents\, and in August 2017 it started a 
 cost recovery phase in order to maintain the sustainability of the project
 .\nIn this talk we will present our environment and focus on how a team of
  two people manage and monitor it.We will cover the open source tools used
  for automated testing of the core functionality provided by the cloud\, p
 erformance monitoring\, capacity planning\, alerting and the integration w
 ork we did to get everythng working using entirely free and open source so
 lutions.Based on the lessons learned after operating a publicly facing clo
 ud environment for almost three years\, this presentation will have someth
 ing new for both Openstack beginners and veterans.\n

DESCRIPTION:Ceph has historically been challenged by transactional workloa
 ds requiring Iow latencies in the sub 10ms range.  This has excluded Ceph
  RBD from a whole class of applications and limited its adoption in the en
 terprise.   New technologies like RDMA\, NVMe and 3D XPoint have emerged
  in the last few years that are having a significant impact on Ceph by ena
 bling deterministic\, low latency (sub 10ms) performance.  In this talk w
 e explore these technologies\, demonstrating how they can be used in a Ce
 ph Luminous Cluster to deliver groundbreaking performance\, opening whole 
 new classes of workloads to the Ceph ecosystem.

DESCRIPTION:Using OpenStack for a public cloud has a range of challenges\,
  and one of hardest parts is often billing. This is an area deployers may 
 run into some frustrating and unexpected problems.\nDeployers expect a goo
 d billing system to inergrate with their existing ERP system\, but those i
 ntegrations likely need custom features and flexibility.\nThey need to be 
 ready to handle bugs in the telemetry chain (service bugs\, notification b
 ugs\, ceilometer bugs)\, and make sure their billing isn't missing informa
 tion because of it.\nTheir solution needs to be able to handle at least 10
 00+ customers and 50+ metrics/products.\nIn this session\, we will share t
 he first-hand experience about running billing on Catalyst Cloud\, which i
 s a public cloud based in New Zealand.

 r connecting\, managing and securing microservices.   With services runnin
 g in multiple clouds\, service mesh has to be established across the cloud
 s.   In this presentation John and Tim will show how an application can be
  stretched between two disparate cloud environments--public cloud and an O
 penStack based cloud.   The demonstration will show how the service mesh i
 s stretched to fully enable service mesh features for all services and end

DESCRIPTION:As a core component of Openstack\, a deployment of Neutron pla
 ys a critical role in determining the achieved latency and throughput of t
 he virtual network. Consequently\, the network performance of VMs' communi
 cation in an Openstack deployment directly depends on how Neutron is deplo
 yed.\nThis presentation looks deeper into DPDK as an enabler of faster pac
 ket processing in a Neutron deployment. It focuses on introducing DPDK as 
 a technology\, its core components\, and explaining how it can be used in 
 an Openstack deployment to improve the network virtualization. The present
 ation illustrates the layout of a DPDK enabled openvswitch deployment exp
 laining how packets flow within this layout and where performance improvem
 ents are achieved. The presentation ends by briefly showing a comparison 
 of the virtual network performance of a traditional deployment vs a DPDK e

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T225000Z
UID:21300@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:One of the most exciting concepts in the 5G paradigm is the id
 ea of Network Slicing (NS). While NS has not been ratified as a standard a
 s of yet\, current drafts suggest NS requires the end to end network virtu
 alization and the ability to manage Quality of Service (QoS). Further\, as
  specified by various standards bodies\, NS effectively requires APIs exis
 t to manage it.\nMany of the major requirements of 5G NS are already satis
 fied by OpenStack networking\, such as QoS\, isolation\, segregation\, sha
 ring networks\, and of course\, automation/orchestration via Neutron APIs.
 \nIn this presentation we will review what NS is based on draft documents 
 by standards bodies\, as well as what requirements of NS are satisfied by 
 OpenStack. We will explore how OpenStack can be integrated in a SP network
  in order to enable NS. We will also demonstrate a simulated SP network an
 d what level of NS can currently be accomplished by OpenStack and Manageme
 nt and Orchestration (MANO) systems such as Open Baton.

 ntrol (RBAC).  While there is\, as of yet\, no interoperability between th
 em.  There is also no attempt to support the applications running on top o
 f them.  In this presentation\, we'll go through the RBAC mechanisms of bo
 th layers\, and then discuss how to extend a unified view of RBAC to the e

 project configurations are continuously audited against defined rules with
  alerts generated for violations (a security group that allows unrestricte
 d SSH to an Internet-facing VM or public Swift containers). By keeping an 
 inventory and history of all deltas\, owners have visibility into when ite
 ms are created\, modified\, or removed. Security Monkey can be easily exte

DESCRIPTION:   One of the challenges for NFV is to achieve the performance
  as high as dedicated hardware. SR-IOV is used for such a purpose. However
 \, you lose the flexibility of virtualization because it highly depends on
  hardware.\n   DPDK is emerging solution for NFV\, but there are still dif
 ficulties to use it in OpenStack. This is because DPDK should be aware of 
 physical computing resources\, such as NIC ports\, CPU cores\, and NUMA no
 des.\n   In this talk\, we show how much the performance changes if those 
 physical resources are well tuned for optimization. We explain how to work
  around tuning difficulties in OpenStack giving an illustration of the usa
 ge of networking-spp. Networking-spp is a Neutron ML2 plugin for SPP (Soft
  Patch Panel). SPP is implemented on DPDK. It behaves like a patch panel a
 nd enables VNFs to communicate each other.\n   We also mention the remaini
 ng tasks for optimization and how they are going to be solved in the Place
 ment\, a resource management service from the Nova project.

DESCRIPTION:Network services today consist of multiple virtual network fun
 ctions (VNFs) which are usually deployed across multiple domains. To conne
 ct different domains\, the NFV orchestrator often has to interface with va
 rious legacy systems and physical network functions to establish well desi
 gned underlay (e.g. Layer3 VPN based on WAN or SPTN) and overlay (e.g. EV
 PN based VXLAN). In each domain OpenStack is usually used to build an op
 en infrastructure. While\, the third-party SDN products from legacy networ
 k system vendors are also leveraged to manage virtual networks. It becomes
  problems how to coordinate the local virtual networks and legacy SDN pro
 ducts and how to achieve the VPN connectivity across different domains. I
 n this presentation\, we will introduce a Neutron ML2 hierarchical port bi
 nding based solution by a typical NFV use case built in ONAP Amsterdam Rel

DESCRIPTION:Critical to migrating workloads to cloud-native architectures 
 and the public cloud\, is providing storage compatibility between file-bas
 ed applications and cloud-native applications. \nHow can filesystem-based 
 applications interface with cloud-native applications? How can filesystem-
 based application leverage public/private-cloud infrastructure?\nProxyFS i
 s an open-source filesystem integrated into OpenStack Swift to solve this 
 problem. ProxyFS enables simultaneous object (S3 and Swift) and filesystem
  access (NFS or SMB) to the same data. At the same time\, ProxyFS is a com
 pelling filesystem in its own right\, that can not only leverage the stora
 ge capabilities of OpenStack Swift\, but can utilize capacity in the publi
 c cloud. \nWe look forward to sharing these exciting developments that wil
 l broaden Swift's ability to support more application workloads.

 as a layer on top of Kolla’s core containers. This solution allows vendo

 g to stay out-of-tree. With this solution\, OpenStack operators can still 
 utilize the power of Kolla’s installer infrastructure to install these c
 ontainers and also integrate into its configuration framework. The solutio

 images.\nIn this talk\, we will explain the best practices to containerize
  OpenStack vendor plugins and use vendor hardware or vendor NFV and use 3r

 ations. Pouch\, an open source container project started by Alibaba\, aims
  at improving the degree of isolation at the very beginning of its develop
 ment. Hypervisor-based container technology by supporting kata-container/r
 unv\, lxcfs guaranteed resource view isolation\, and dirquota supporting a
 re several isolation features of Pouch's. We will mostly introduce on hype
 rvisor-based container technology by kata-container/runv on why we choose 
 it\, how we support it\, what we achieve via it. This is fitable for those
  who are seeking strong-isolation solutions on container ecosystem\, and w
 ho are finding practical ways to adopt fancy cloud native technologies in 
 their legacy IT datacenters. What's more\, a demo of supporting katacontai
 ner/runV in Pouch and running a legacy application on old kernels will be 
 presented.

DESCRIPTION:CERN is the home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\, a 27km c
 ircular proton accelerator generating tens of petabytes of new data every 
 year. Data is stored and processed using a large amount of resources total
 ing over 250.000 cores and 1000s of storage servers\, managed by OpenStack
 .\nNetworking is a critical part of our infrastructure and arguably the ha
 rdest to evolve. Given the size of CERN&rsquo\;s infrastructure\, its flat
  network is partitioned in segments each representing a separate broadcast
  domain and potentially offering different levels of service. This fragmen
 tation improves scalability and reduces the impact of misbehaving systems 
 in the datacentre to individual segments. On the other hand\, having multi
 ple broadcast domains means features like floating and virtual IPs are muc
 h harder to offer.\nWe will tell the story of OpenStack Networking at CERN
 . First integration with Nova Network\, the migration to Neutron and how w
 e're adding SDN in our infrastructure.

 ovide a viable alternative to run containers on the cloud. The serverless 
 approach allows users to run containers without having to pre-create or ma
 nage their own clusters.\nIn this presentation\, we will talk about how we
  adopt the serverless approach. We will leverage Kubernetes as the orchest
 ration layer and make Kubernetes provision &ldquo\;serverless&rdquo\; cont

  modifications to the source code using a web browser to approve or reject
  those changes.\nIn this session we will walk participants through opening
  a bug in a test system and then submit a patch to a repository in OpenSta
 c k. The process involves learning about Git using the most common command
 s and progressing through the review process in Gerrit. Participants will 
 walk away with a working knowledge of these tools.

SUMMARY:Kubernetes and OpenStack Policy Management

UID:21052@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:In a paradigm where operators are deploying OpenStack using Ku
 bernetes\, difficulties surrounding common issues such as authentication a
 nd policy enforcement multiply as OpenStack and Kubernetes have different 
 ecosystems. In the case of policy decision point\, OpenStack leverages key
 stone and oslo.policy\, while Kubernetes provides mechanism to use externa
 l policy engine.\nThis talk proposes a proof of concept to leverage a sing
 le external policy decision point (PDP) engine that would centralize PDP f
 or both OpenStack and Kubernetes. Effort to leverage external system such 
 as Apache Fortress was considered\, but the introduction of java to both O
 penStack's python code base and Kubernetes's golang code base proved chall
 enging. This talk proposes an alternative solution: Open Policy Agent (htt
 p://www.openpolicyagent.org/). As this is designed with cloud native envir
 onment in mind\, this can be adapted by oslo.policy to centralize policy-b
 ased control.

  popularity in this space\, where Ceph client and OSD components compete f
 or resources with VNF compute instances.  NFV deployments aim at maximizin
 g VNF packing\, thus resource available for storage is precious\, particul
 arly Ceph RBD client\, which we found to be a significant consumer of CPU 
 resources on a Hyperconverged node. This motivated us to take an in-depth 
 look at the Ceph RBD client datapath\, which hasn't been a focus in the pa
 st. Join us to hear about this exploration\, performance profiling howtos\
 , our current findings and opportunities for performance optimizations as 
 it relates to Telco NFV.

DESCRIPTION:In container networking\, there is always a conflict between t
 he higher forwarding speed demand and the less resources(cores/threads/mem
 ory) to run the containers. To resolve this problem\, we introduced DPDK a
 s microservices to ZTE's container network. We used some features of dpdk 
 such as primary/secondary mode\, lockless ring\, sharing memory\, virtio_u
 ser\, vhost and so on\, to promote the performance. At the same time\, we 
 used a heartbeat-like mechanism to keep alive and a fail-safe mechanism to
  provide high availability. Our model achieved bidirectional zero-copy bet
 ween containers which brought us high performance at a cost of only one de
 dicated thread. This model could be used in 5G network slicing and other I
 CT areas.

DESCRIPTION:China Mobile's private cloud project at Hohehot data center\, 
 has built 1800 virtualization nodes and 3000 baremetal nodes for single po
 d. During the construction and integration stage\, we recorded the difficu
 lty in deploymemt and performance limit for multi-region environment. We 
 study the networking scheme for neutron integrated with data center\, and 
 resolve the high concurrency problem with fcsan and serversan.\nIn this ta
 lk we will show how to overcome these difficulty and build a large-scale p
 rivate cloud gracefully.\nInclude:* Architecture* Use-cases* Deployment* T
 roubleshooting skills* Common issues\nAttendees will know.How to achieve g
 ood performace for muli-region with 1800 V-nodes and 3000 B-nodes ?How to 
 integrated trust zone and demilitarized zone with OpenStack(Nova\, Neutron
 \, Cinder\, Ironic)?How to coordinate cinder'process synchronization with

SUMMARY:Closing the Loop between ONAP and OpenStack for the Resilience of 
 Network Services

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180523T002000Z

DESCRIPTION:NFV deployment is a multi-layered stack where a unified Orches
 trator such as ONAP takes the responsibility of closed-loop automation for
  the resilience of virtual network function (VNF). The closed-loop should 
 be event driven for both efficiency and accuracy. The closed-loop is trigg
 ered by some symptom usually coming from given alert or event.  Once trig
 gered\, a predefined policy is used to connect the symptom with proper rec
 over operations which is a status machine relying on events too. So\, the 
 design of event driven framework becomes the key of closed loop. VNFs are 
 often deployed and running on OpenStack for its rich resource management f
 unctions and API. To transfer the events from OpenStack to ONAP\, we need 
 to weave together various message bus systems and event sources. In this p
 resentation\, we will share an innovated framework which federates the eve
 nts/alerts/metrics across different layers and sources with a demo of clos
 ed-loop automation through typical NFV use cases.

DESCRIPTION:Telexistence is a fundamental concept named for the general te
 chnology that enables a human being to have a real-time sensation of being
  at a place other than where he or she actually exists\, and being able to
  interact with the remote environment\, which may be real\, virtual\, or a
  combination of both. It is an advanced and emerging technology in robotic
 s\, which combines Virtual Reality\, Remote Sensing\, Real-time Communicat
 ion\, Cloud Networking\, Machine Learning\, Humanoid Robots together. With
  the rapid development of telecommunication\, especially 5G\, edge computi
 ng\, IOT infrastructure\, telexistence is becoming realistic and producibl
 e\, rather than cinematic concept or research topic.\nAs a startup company
  in telexistence\, we would love to share our knowledge and ideas about ho
 w to build a large-scale and distributed cloud networking control plane de
 dicated to telexistence in days. The most important point is that this SDN
  architecture is fully powered by OpenStack.

 s solutions have been proposed for this challenge. Some solutions use Magn
 um\, Kuryr\, Fuxi\, or Zun to solve management and networking issues\, but
  create strong linkage to OS. Others manage containers at VM level\, so OS
  commands can be used\, not K8S commands. Fully isolated environments coul
 d use one OS platform for cloud native\, container only platforms and anot
 her for VMs\, connecting them by a VNF with both containers and VMs\, or w
 ith an SDN controller for the networking part. Our option allows VNFs to b
 e developed for hybrid environments\, where installation is based on OS an
 d networking uses Calico BGP to distribute Neutron networks to container d
 omain.We address lifecycle management\, including installation\, managemen
 t\, networking and root cause analysis in the hybrid world.

DESCRIPTION:Since 2012\, CERN is running an OpenStack cloud with currently
  around 300k cores to provide compute resources to the Large Hadron Collid
 er (LHC)\, the most powerful proton accelerator in the world. To complete 
 the service's offering by provisioning bare metal nodes in addition to vir
 tual machines and containers\, we recently started to integrate Ironic int
 o our service deployment.\nIn this presentation we will go through the int
 egration process as well as the challenges arising from running the bare m
 etal service in an environment managed by multiple teams responsible for d
 ifferent parts of and workflows in the datacenter.\nWe will also show the 
 benefits of moving everything under a unified OpenStack umbrella from both
 \, the user's as well as the operators' perspective. While provisioning ne
 wly arrived hardware and giving access to "exotic" configurations was the 
 primary task\, we will also describe our efforts to transparently migrate 
 already deployed servers into this new service.

DESCRIPTION:Image management is the core of any infrastructure. As a servi
 ce provider or a consumer of infrastructure\, one needs a guarantee of the
  integrity of the image being used and ensure it is free from vulnerabilit
 ies. In situations of hybrid infrastructure\, it is challenging to ensure 
 the security and compliance policies are met uniformly across VMs\, contai
 ners\, and bare-metal images.  Also\, with growing workload needs of the h
 ybrid environment\, there&rsquo\;s a need for pre-baked application ready 
 images to reduce provisioning time.\nAs a solution to above challenges\, w
 e will demonstrate a framework\, capable of creating pre-packaged applicat
 ion images for containers\, bare-metal\, and VMs along with scanning them 
 for CVE&rsquo\;s.

DESCRIPTION:Swisscom TV MediaCloud is currently operating a large OpenStac
 k-based cloud for supporting NFV applications and is expanding further as 
 we on-board more applications. Our deployment runs on COTS servers and is
  fully capable for service level orchestration. Swisscom currently impleme
 nts virtualized/containerized TV media functions such as transcoding\, str
 eaming\, and hosting backend applications. Using respective API functions 
 of TV MediaCloud\, Swisscom is able to deploy services within minutes inst
 ead of weeks.\nIn this talk\, we will share the challenges and the lessons
  learned in designing and building this OpenStack-based NFV Cloud. We will
  focus on both business and technical aspects of the NFV applications we o
 n-boarded and how that translated into the highly challenging requirements
  from the underlying cloud. For example\, to ensure hugh availability of e
 very component and no single point of failure\, we needed to support ZERO 
 packet loss multicast traffic and very low jitter.\n \n \n

UID:20651@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Cloud Edge computing use cases range from IoT to VR/AR and any
  widely distributed application in between.  However\, taking OpenStack ou
 t of the data center requires an entirely new approach to security when th
 ere is far less ability to restrict access and often the applications requ
 ire a shared tenant model. Some of the factors that need to be considered 
 include:\n\nMore stringent requirements for infrastructure software (code/
 design) in exposed environments\nNew ways of thinking about RBAC at the co
 ntrol interfaces\nConflicts arising from shared ownership and divided resp
 onsibilities for devices/systems/applications\nManaging lifecycle operatio
 ns and deployments over insecure WAN connections\nDifferent ways of lookin
 g at tenant spaces in remote locations\nImposing network/compute/storage/m
 emory separation from the underlying virtualization/hardware components\nM
 anaging security over intermittent WAN connections\nSecuring semi-autonomo
 us and self-managed locations\n

DESCRIPTION:The Red Hat OpenStack® Platform scheduler is optimized to run
  as many virtual machines on a single host as possible. However\, with mod
 ern x86 servers\, the default behavior can lead to non-optimal performance
  of individual virtual machines. CPU pinning and OpenStack Nova filters ca

 achieve better performance for specific virtual machines.\nIn this session
 \, Razique Mahroua will demonstrate how to optimize performance when deplo
 ying large Red Hat OpenStack Platform environments. We'll cover:\nHow to o
 ptimize distributed virtual routing and performance tuning\, including the
  NUMA architecture\, CPU pinning\, host aggregates\, hugepages\, and compu
 te scheduler filters.\nThe details of how to configure and use of DVR\, th

DESCRIPTION:As more and more workloads move off dedicated hardware into th

 rmance and guarantee the quality of service. Contention for hardware resou
 rce such as cache\, memory and network bandwidth affects performance in th
 e same vein as resources such as CPU and RAM，especially for latency and 
 jitter sensitive Network Virtual Functions (NFV) workload. We introduce Re
 source Management Daemon (RMD)\, a system daemon running on generic Linux 
 platforms\, to provide cache allocation capability to the resource control
  arsenal.\nIn this talk we discuss the Resource Management Daemon (RMD) ar
 chitecture\, components\, and the design of monitor component that will tr
 ack and fine tune allocations to meet service level agreements. We then sh
 ow how RMD significantly benefits the NFV use case. Last but not least we 
 share how RMD can be leveraged by cloud and container orchestration engine
 s to effectively introduce cache allocation capabilities.

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180523T213000Z
UID:21134@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:In the Container world\, there is a need to build observabilit
 y around apps and backing services running in containers.\nThe observabili
 ty should allow to capture on demand low level metrics at a low overhead.\
 nThe proposal is to use ebpf as the tracing technology to capture details 
 at kernel & user level\, and generate on demand flamegraphs\, heat maps fo
 r applications & backing services.\nThe Linux kernel has a built-in BPF JI
 T compiler\, and an in-kernel verifier which is used to validate eBPF prog
 rams. This allows user defined instrumentation on a live kernel image that
  can never crash\, hang or interfere with the kernel negatively. eBPF prov
 ides in-kernel implementation of storage maps such as histograms and hash-
 maps\, which helps in efficient copy of summarized monitoring data from ke
 rnel to user space with low overhead.\nThese features make eBPF programs s
 afe to run in production and allow admins and engineers to collect crucial
  data from systems for performance analysis and monitoring.

 e best practices and is often the goal\, few deployments have visibility i
 nto their compliance with these guidelines – and even fewer have an auto
 mated approach that reports compliance. Security audits are often manual a
 nd infrequent (if at all)\, and require manual responses to simple/predict
 able issues (like misconfigured security group rules). This talk will disc
 uss an automated approach to continuous monitoring and enforcement of wide

DESCRIPTION:With the usage of edge clouds\, it will be possible to run ban
 dwidth hungry applications with low latency and ensure significant cost sa
 vings.The cloud will evolve into a distributed network of clouds which are
  connected to each other and holistically managed. Applications can be acc
 elerated by increased responsiveness and maximized interactivity from the 
 edge. Real-time analytics can be performed at the point of capture and cor
 rective actions\, can be taken locally.The ETSI MEC group has specified th
 e architecture\, interfaces and APIs for a distributed application platfor
 m. The MEC specifications aim to stimulate innovation and promote interope
 rability and deployment. They enable rapid service creation and delivery\,
  efficient and intelligent orchestration and flexible exposure of network 
 and context information. In this presentation we will discuss the MEC requ
 irements for the infrastructure and show how an OpenStack based edge host 
 can fulfill these requirements.

DESCRIPTION:It has never been a better time to be a developer! Thanks to c
 loud computing\, deploying our applications is much easier than it used to
  be\, especially after Function-as-a-Service emerged. Despite the big name
 s such as AWS Lambda\, Google Cloud Functions\, etc. how the OpenStack end
  users(especially public cloud users) can get benefits from FaaS as well?\
 nQinling\, an official OpenStack project which was approved at the end of 
 Queens development cycle\, is aiming at providing FaaS for OpenStack. As p
 art of the OpenStack ecosystem\, it is tightly integrated with most of the
  other OpenStack services in order to empower the service users or applica
 tion developers.\nIn this presentation\, I will revisit the challenges tha
 t current FaaS implementations are facing\, and how we solved(or partially
  solved) those issues in Qinling. Most importantly\, this topic will also 
 cover how Qinling interacts with other open source community(e.g. Kubernet
 es\, Kata Containers) during its implementation.

DESCRIPTION:Since 2016\, the FEMDC SiG has been investigating how OpenStac
 k could operate Edge Cloud infrastructures. Among the challenges that have
  been identified by the SiG\, dealing with latency issues and network spli
 t brains is important for most OpenStack services.\nIn this presentation\,
  we focus on how they impact the Keystone Identity Service. Keystone offer
 s different deployment approaches\, from a centralized one\, to a federati
 on\, as well as a replication using database clustering. By varying the nu
 mber of regions and latency between those regions\, we compare the followi
 ng deployments:\n\nOne centralized Keystone handling requests of all regio
 ns\nA replicated Keystone using Galera Cluster to synchronize databases in
  the different regions\nA replicated Keystone leveraging the NewSQL Cockro
 achDB database\nA federated Keystone\n\nWe present the methodology\, resul
 ts and identification of possible improvements towards a more decentralize
 d management of the OpenStack services.\n

UID:21024@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Upgrading directly from Juno to Ocata is something the OpenSta
 ck community never intended for anyone to do\, however we at Oath managed 
 it with almost zero impact on our customers. A key piece of this task was 
 running five database migrations across three components (Nova\, Glance\, 
 and Keystone)\, which took about an hour. Related work leading up to this 
 migration was the re-imaging of almost 1\,000 HVs to upgrade the OS and Li
 bvirt\, and also migrating our custom patches and plugins to work with the
  Ocata code base. During this entire process\, any given VM was only down 
 for a few hours during the HV upgrade\, while the Nova API had even less d
 owntime. We are currently expanding on this work for the Juno to Ocata upg
 rade of Ironic and Neutron in our Bare Metal clusters and will publish det
 ails on this at a later date.

DESCRIPTION:The Kubernetes on OpenStack on Kubernetes Sandwich is now a tr

 s including Kolla-K8s\, OpenStack-Helm\, Magnum and Senlin. In this presen

 luster with Helm Charts\, before using Ironic and Heat to bring up additio
 nal kubernetes masters and expand to a secure\, highly available control p
 lane\, backed by Ceph-Helm for storage.  With this foundation\, we then pr
 ovision compute hosts that can be used either as pure Kubernetes\, or Open
 Stack compute nodes.  We will demonstrate using Keystone as a unified IAM 
 solution for this platform.  This community-driven architecture has the po
 tential to radically simplify cluster management at scale. Taking advantag
 e of the best of both the OpenStack and Kubernetes ecosystems\, to manage 
 the life cycle of a data center from day 0 into the future

DESCRIPTION:Beyond OpenStack for IT\, NFV is another killer use case. Hori

 Hence\, Identity and Access Management (IAM) module becomes a key issue.\n
 The proposed solution enables dynamic policy reconfiguration instead of st
 atic OSLO policy.json and enables external PDP to manage multiple OpenStac
 k deployments for NFV NGPoPs. The organization of this PDP contains a set 
 of upstreamed hooks to OpenStack/OSLO\, OpenDaylight/AAA\, and possibly Op
 enContrail in the future. It also proposed a reference implementation of t

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack's approach to monitoring VM's has traditionally been
  a very 'black box' approach.  VNF Managers have played the role of map
 ping between a VM's  Application-Specific state and OpenStack's manageme
 nt of the VM.  Recent work  in the OpenStack Masakari project has start
 ed to look at leveraging a simple standardized  API between an OpenStack
  compute host and it's hosted Guest VMs. Such work enables  capabilities
  as 'active' / white-box type monitoring of the VM and Applications within
  the VM\,  graceful notifications of potentially service-affecting admin
 istrative commands on the VM\,  and even the ability to NACK these poten
 tially service-affecting commands if the HA VM is  not fully synchronize
 d with it's peer VM. In this session we'll discuss the pros and cons of 
  such an approach\, and provide a simple demo of these capabilities.

DESCRIPTION:Kuryr is an OpenStack project that provides a framework for ad
 apting different kinds of networking to Cloud Native workloads. Kuryr CNI 
 supports mixed environments with workloads deployed both on  Bare Metal an
 d Virtual Machines.\nIn order to provide networking to  different worker n
 odes it can use varied virtual devices such as SR-IOV and VLAN.\nKuryr has
  a generic Kubernetes controller that allows watching different Kubernetes
  resources and perform actions in response to their events. It can support
  multiple networking backends. Kuryr default implementation is based on Op
 enStack Neutron\, it can be easily extended to serve other SDNs.\nIn this 
 talk we will dive into Kuryr-Kubernetes CNI\, explaining its architecture.
  In addition we will show with the Dragonflow example that Kuryr provides 
 a generic SDN framework for different networking backends by implementing 
 some pluggable Python modules.

  OpenStack will not do that for you out of the box!\nHelp is on its way.\n
 We developed an OpenStack extension that ensures confidentiality and integ

 distributed cloud components. It encrypts user data prior to cloud entry. 
 The encryption keys are managed by the OpenStack client. They are not stor

DESCRIPTION:5G standards are designed to take advantage of virtualization 
 and edge computing. They are meant to adapt automatically to changes in de
 mand. The massively distributed clouds that result will be complex and th
 ere are many implementation decisions to make.\nThe scale of 5G network\, 
 the distribution of the control function\, reemphasize not just the need f
 or automation but also the benefits of AI and predictive analytics. \nAut
 omation will be built in multiple systems that have complementary but some
 time overlapping scope. Openstack is one of them. The variety of architect
 ures result in a variety of options.\nAutoscaling is a good example of suc
 h automation. Some of this logic will be built into the application layer 
 possibly by a specialized microservice. But some of it can be built at the
  network layer in some Master orchestrator such as ONAP. Still some may al
 so be built at the node level\, in the Virtual infrastructure manager or i

 NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol)is a much better alternative for connec
 tivity than multiple site to site VPN tunnels to form a mesh. It provides 
 a mechanism to enable a fully meshed network between the different endpoin
 ts using multipoint GRE and IPSec. A Routing protocol is used to exchange 
 Route information. The dynamic nature of the protocol minimizes configurat
 ion changes with changes to the topology. We share our experience along wi

DESCRIPTION:OPNFV Doctor is building a framework to have infrastructure ma
 intenance and upgrade done in interaction with the application running on 
 top of it. By having this\, the application is able to keep zero downtime 
 with its service during the operations as well as to be able to utilize ne
 w capabilities of the upgraded underlying compute nodes. Not only the appl
 ication benefits from this\, but also the infrastructure admin\, as he can
  even request to down scale the application. That is\, for rolling upgrade
 s in networking systems where there may not be sufficient resources to per
 form rolling upgrade\, e.g. due to strict Return on Investment (ROI) polic
 y for the special Telco hardware used. Using the proposed framework\, you 
 can first down scale the application to free capacity on your hardware for
  then triggering the rolling upgrade. Presentation shows how this and much
  more will be accomplished.

DESCRIPTION:Access control plays a very important role for both the cloud 
 providers and tenants to make optimal use of the OpenStack Features. Today
  Role Based Access Control rules are fixed before deployment on an OpenSta
 ck instance into a datacenter. Any changes to these roles\, is a very manu
 al and tedious process that causes consistency issues across 100s of deplo
 yment and ends up in creating a snow flake deployment environment. Since g
 ranular roles are not available\, users are tend to be given privileged ro
 les. Higher privilege access causes a lot of issues including inadvertent 
 deletes\, access to  tenant data\, and other security issues. With Dynami
 c RBAC\, it provides the flexibility for Cloud Administrators to define st
 ringent RBAC rules in real time and apply/activate these roles immediately
  eliminating the need to the next deployment cycle and tightening any secu
 rity loop holes.

DESCRIPTION:Placement in OpenStack carries two fundamental issues that lim
 it its scalability. First\, Nova scheduler is too slow for large clouds\, 
 as it requires full knowledge of the system's state for its decisions. Sec
 ond\, the orchestration engine (Heat) enables launching multi-VM cloud app
 lications\, but deploys them one at a time since Nova lacks the required a
 pplication level awareness. This may lead to under-utilization and sub-opt
 imal performance.\nThis session addresses both issues. We will show a fast
 er alternative to Nova scheduler and an enhancement for application level 
 deployment. Through extensive evaluation on real datasets\, we will show t
 hat the new scheduler achieves up to x5.3 faster placements with similar q
 uality.  We will also show that our enhancement improves the performance 
 and acceptance ratio of network services.

 In other cases\, some over-subscription may be possible without impacting 
 services. In addition to tying a given nova VM together with its foundatio
 nal levels\, each VNF frequently contains multiple nova instances\, neutro
 n networks\, and cinder volumes\, which also must be considered when over-
 subscribing.

DESCRIPTION:In this session we will talk something about OpenStack based H
 PC ecosystem which is currently running on TianHe-2 Super computer. Curren
 tly we have thousands of nodes running in production mainly used for simul
 ation\, analysis\, and government security applications. In order to get b
 est performance for compute intensive application\, LXC is used as virtual
 ization for OpenStack\, lots of optimizations have been made and some patc
 hes are added to kernel and nova to support features like volume based LXC
 \, GPU passthrough for better performance.\nThis session will focus on how
  we tuning/modify Openstack and Operating system for large scale HPC\, and
  what's we gained by running HPC on OpenStack.
