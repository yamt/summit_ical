DESCRIPTION:Airship is a collection of interoperable and loosely coupled o
 pen source tools that provide for automated cloud provisioning and life cy
 cle management in a completely declarative and predictable way. The focus 
 of this project is the implementation of a declarative platform to introdu
 ce OpenStack on Kubernetes\, and the lifecycle management of the resulting
  cloud. Airship achieves this by managing the lifecycle of the entire stac
 k\, from the baremetal infrastructure and network configuration\, to the D
 ocker configuration and Kubernetes cluster\, as well as OpenStack. It does
  this with the scale\, speed\, resiliency\, flexibility and operational pr
 edictability demanded of Network Clouds at scale.\nThis presentation provi
 des an overview of the Airship project and its recent transition to the Op
 enStack foundation. You can expect to learn what services and components m
 ake up the Airship project as well as how they work together to provide de
 clarative and predictable lifecycle management for your cloud and the adva
 ntages this brings for operators. We will review how this is leveraged tod
 ay by several companies and how you can get started using and contributing
  to the project.\nAt its core\, the Airship project has four main objectiv
 es:\nBE DECLARATIVE Sites are declared using YAML. This includes both hard
  assets such as network configuration and bare metal hosts as well as soft
  assets like helm charts\, their overrides\, and container images. You man
 age the document and Airship implements it.\nONE WORKFLOW FOR LIFE CYCLE M
 ANAGEMENT We needed a system that was predictable with life cycle manageme
 nt at its core. This meant ensuring we had one workflow that handled both 
 initial deployments as well as future site updates. In other words\, there
  should be virtually nothing different when interacting with a new deploym
 ent or providing an an update to an existing site.\nCONTAINERS AS THE NEW 
 UNIT OF SOFTWARE DELIVERY Containers are the unit of software delivery for
  Airship. Everything is a container. This allows us to predictably promote
  hermetically sealed containers from development\, to testing\, and finall
 y production with confidence.\nFLEXIBLE FOR DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES AND SO
 FTWARE Airship is delivering environments both very small and large with a
  wide range of configurations. We use Airship to manage our entire cloud p
 latform\, not just OpenStack.

DESCRIPTION:Modern research computing needs at academic institutions are e
 volving. While traditional HPC satisfies most workflows\, researchers seek
  sophisticated\, on-demand\, and self-service control of compute infrastru
 cture. Furthermore\, many also seek policy-compliant safe spaces to comput
 e on sensitive or protected data.\nTo cater to these users\, the Minnesota
  Supercomputing Institute deployed an OpenStack cloud called Stratus. In c
 ontrast to typical clouds\, Stratus does not manage internal infrastructur
 e\; rather\, Stratus complements bare-metal\, fully-managed HPC\, with a s
 elf-service model that can accommodate non-traditional computational and s
 torage needs with HPC-like performance.  \nThis talk describes the lesson
 s learned in launching a platform to support research with specific data-u
 se agreements\; and also issues concerning accountability\, risk acceptanc
 e\, and the role of project leadership when a large supercomputing facilit
 y deviates from its traditional base of support.

DESCRIPTION:Managing OpenStack environments requires visibility and observ
 ability. However many OpenStack deployments have limited monitoring tools 
 and as a result enginteers lack visibility into the workings of the OpenSt
 ack environment. In this track you will learn about an OpenStack native mo
 nitoring tool called Monasca (Monitoring As A Service At Scale) that provi
 des visibility into OpenStack environments. Monasca provides visibility of
  compute\, block storage\, image service\, authentication\, networking\, a
 nd more. In this presentation we plan to cover:- A tour of OP5's implement
 ation of Monasca- How to deploy Monasca on bare metal and within OpenStack
 - Best practices for OpenStack monitoringAbout OP5OP5 has developed an ent
 erprise level monitoring solution with full support for OpenStack. It is b
 ased upon the OpenStack project Monasca\, meaning a high performing scalab
 le fault tolerant solution from start.Monasca is based on microservice arc
 hitecture which enables high scalability\, both horizontally and verticall
 y\, and as a result OP5's monitoring solution is able to process millions 
 of metrics per second.OP5's monitoring solution for OpenStack can also han
 dle constant data streams being both pulled and pushed from within the env
 ironment. The architecture is built on a highly-performant message bus cap
 able of ingesting a constant flow of data streams as opposed to a master-s
 lave polling for events.Our solution supports agent authentication through
  Keystone\, a OpenStack authentication project. The use of tenants make it
  possible to separate authentication and authorization on a per-project-ba
 sis\, and It makes it possible to separate departments or customers sharin
 g the same platform\, giving a reliable\, multi-tenant solution.In the sam
 e vein as OP5's other monitoring solutions\, this is based upon robust API
 s enabling integrations with other applications for analytics and visualiz
 ation\, such as Grafana.

DESCRIPTION:Mentoring has always been a big part of the OpenStack Communit
 y and the time has come for changes. Historically\, the Women of OpenStack
  have owned and run the mentoring program that our community offers to new
  comers. However\, in order to reach a wider audience and to remove any th
 oughts that the program was women only\, we are looking to move the Long T
 erm Mentoring program out from under the Women of OpenStack to a new home.
  Potential groups that already exist that could own/help manage it are: Fi
 rst Contact SIG or Diversity WG.  In addition to a new overlord\, the form
 at of the program itself could use updates. Previously\, there was a 1 men
 tee to 1 mentor ratio that would often struggle for want of a defined goal
  and slow downs when the mentor would switch jobs or be on vacation. The p
 roposed new format will use cohorts to mentor community members and help t
 hem to would require fewer overall mentors helping mentees work towards a 
 defined common goal.  So what does this mean for you? We need one or more 
 volunteers to help get the new program off the ground and oversee the new 
 mentoring program. To be involved from the ground up- helping design what 
 it should look like\, what goals are\, recruiting mentors and mentees- and
  continuing to support the program into the future.

 based on the user's background and specific use cases. We assume there is 
 a diverse set of additional requests and requirements for such reservation
  service. This forum session covers the followings items:\n What additiona

 tual resource: network (floating IP addresses\, subnets\, bandwith\, etc.)
 \, volume (volume storage)\, or another resource?\n physical resource: net
 work (bandwith in host?)\, PCI-passthrough devices\, etc.\n How to create 
 a reservation and how to provision a reserved resource?\n Do users create 
 their reserved resource with reservation-id (this is a way the instance/ho
 st reservations do)?\n Does Blazar create their reserved resource at start
 _time and assign the resource to the user?\n Resource utilization\n  In ad

DESCRIPTION:One of the most exciting concepts in the 5G paradigm is the id
 ea of Network Slicing (NS). While NS has not been ratified as a standard a
 s of yet\, current drafts suggest NS requires the end to end network virtu
 alization and the ability to manage Quality of Service (QoS). Further\, as
  specified by various standards bodies\, NS effectively requires APIs exis
 t to manage it.\nMany of the major requirements of 5G NS are already satis
 fied by OpenStack networking\, such as QoS\, isolation\, segregation\, sha
 ring networks\, and of course\, automation/orchestration via Neutron APIs.
 \nIn this presentation we will review what NS is based on draft documents 
 by standards bodies\, as well as what requirements of NS are satisfied by 
 OpenStack. We will explore how OpenStack can be integrated in a SP network
  in order to enable NS. We will also demonstrate a simulated SP network an
 d what level of NS can currently be accomplished by OpenStack and Manageme

DESCRIPTION:Authentication and authorization for humans is\, more or less\
 , a solved problem. However\, how do you trust the identity of the hosts (
 instances) in your cloud? How can you be assured that in a world of man-in
 -the-middle attacks (arp spoofing\, dns cache poisoning\, etc) that a give
 n instance really is who it claims to be? And how can we do this without r
 equiring any manual intervention on the part of a human. \nAt Oath\, we&rs
 quo\;ve leveraged the power of Open Source to solve exactly this problem. 
  We have developed and open sourced a service authentication and authoriza
 tion system called Athenz. By leveraging the strengths of OpenStack and At
 henz\, we&rsquo\;ve created a solution called &lsquo\;Copper Argos&rsquo\;
  to provide attestable identity in the form of a unique short lived x509 a
 nd SSH host certificate for every single instance in our cloud. In this ta
 lk we will describe the value and design of this system and its components
 .

DESCRIPTION:Using public cloud resources to cover for peak workloads is a 
 practical and economical alternative to over provisioning on-premise resou
 rces. This is the case in environments like CERN where its large internal 
 computing infrastructure is usually big enough but where periods prior to 
 big international conferences or large event reconstruction campaigns see 
 a significant spike in the amount of workloads submitted.\nWe describe ear
 ly experiences relying on Kubernetes federations deployed and managed by O
 penStack Magnum to expand the available capacity to external clouds\, whil
 e still offering a single entrypoint to our users - using GKE\, AKS\, Amaz
 on and other clouds. We will cover the internals of the federation integra
 tion in Magnum\, and some of the issues we had (mainly networking) and how
  we solved them. We will present how these deployments simplify the integr
 ation with our main batch system\, and how workloads running on external r
 esources access their corresponding datasets.

DESCRIPTION:   One of the challenges for NFV is to achieve the performance
  as high as dedicated hardware. SR-IOV is used for such a purpose. However
 \, you lose the flexibility of virtualization because it highly depends on
  hardware.\n   DPDK is emerging solution for NFV\, but there are still dif
 ficulties to use it in OpenStack. This is because DPDK should be aware of 
 physical computing resources\, such as NIC ports\, CPU cores\, and NUMA no
 des.\n   In this talk\, we show how much the performance changes if those 
 physical resources are well tuned for optimization. We explain how to work
  around tuning difficulties in OpenStack giving an illustration of the usa
 ge of networking-spp. Networking-spp is a Neutron ML2 plugin for SPP (Soft
  Patch Panel). SPP is implemented on DPDK. It behaves like a patch panel a
 nd enables VNFs to communicate each other.\n   We also mention the remaini
 ng tasks for optimization and how they are going to be solved in the Place
 ment\, a resource management service from the Nova project.

DESCRIPTION:A recently proposed spec to Cinder suggests using a database t
 o avoid raciness when multiple schedulers are used in the Cinder environme
 nt. The described raciness is the result of each scheduler having an indep
 endent view of the available resources in the environment. This problem ca
 n be solved by having a single authoritative service for tracking resource
  inventory and usage. Placement does this. This session will bring Placeme
 nt and Cinder community members together to determine how Cinder can use P
 lacement. We will:\n Help Placement developers understand how scheduling c
 urrently works in Cinder.\n Help Cinder developers understand what Placeme
 nt can do.\n Develop short and medium term plans to get started with makin
 g it real.\n This session will also be great for other projects interested
  in learning how Placement can be leveraged for some of their needs\, and 
 hopefully provide an example of how to introduce Placement into their proj

DESCRIPTION:While the number of public and private cloud deployments is ra
 pidly growing the transition towards cloud-native applications is still in
  progress. It is crucial to provide support for different kinds of workloa
 ds by adding functionality even if it is considered somewhat old-fashioned
 .Development of the volume multi-attach feature started in 2014 and the fi
 rst version was released in Queens. We will guide you through the journey 
 of the development process and beyond the history lesson will highlight th
 e use cases behind the high demand from users and vendors alike.You will l
 earn about the functionality including the API design\, caveats and effort
 s put into the CI testing with Tempest and Zuulv3 and plans for improvemen

DESCRIPTION:Data volume is growing at an unprecedented rate\, often withou
 t consummate growth in computation needs. The world that lead to the emerg
 ence of the tenets laid out in the GFS and Map Reduce papers has seen a dr
 amatic transformation\, with over a decade of hardware improvements. Disag
 gregation of compute and storage is now commonplace\, championed by organi
 zations like Netflix\, Amazon\, and Airbnb. Pushing storage down a layer a
 nd treating it as an infrastructure service allows data platform teams to 
 focus on increasing the pace of innovation higher up the stack.\nEngineers
  building data platforms on OpenStack clouds expect a varity of storage se
 rvices. Object storage is increasingly becoming the centerpiece of data pl
 atforms\, as it enables in-situ analysis from elastic workload clusters\, 
 low cost\, and massive scalability. The presentation will detail object st
 orage centric data platform architectures\, and how to build rock solid st
 orage services suitable for data intensive applications.

DESCRIPTION:Wouldn’t it be cool if there was a way to have 3rd party ven
 dor drivers to have a way to build their own Kolla based containers? In th
 is talk\, we propose a framework where 3rd party vendor drivers are built 
 as a layer on top of Kolla’s core containers. This solution allows vendo
 rs to determine how their containers are built and managed while continuin
 g to stay out-of-tree. With this solution\, OpenStack operators can still 
 utilize the power of Kolla’s installer infrastructure to install these c
 ontainers and also integrate into its configuration framework. The solutio
 n does not involve using OpenStack CI to build these 3rd party container 
 images.\nIn this talk\, we will explain the best practices to containerize
  OpenStack vendor plugins and use vendor hardware or vendor NFV and use 3r
 d-party CI to gate them with OpenStack using Kolla and do a cool demo at t
 he end!\n Bring your hardware\, and we'll conainerize its plugins for Ope

 pport a variety of use cases including NFV\, hosting and more. In OpenStac

  improved IPv6 support on storage services and we are closer to supporting
  a cloud fully operating with IPv6. However\, the transition of a cloud to
  IPv6 is not a trivial task\, as the network design change comes with its 
 own set of challenges.\nIn this presentation\, we will give an introductio

 ces. One crucial piece of this is ODL Continuous Delivery Pipelines which
  make the latest & greatest versions of the software available frequently 
 to OPNFV and anyone else interested in them in different forms such as pac
 kages\, containers and so on. OPNFV XCI heavily utilizes ODL CD Pipelines
  to create integrated solutions for next generation telecom networks. Thi

DESCRIPTION:Container technology is widely spread in the world. All adopte
 rs are considering how to provide strongly isolated environment for applic
 ations. PouchContainer\, an open source container project started by Aliba
 ba\, aims at improving the degree of isolation at the very beginning of it
 s development. Hypervisor-based container technology by supporting kata-co
 ntainer/runv\, lxcfs guaranteed resource view isolation\, and dirquota sup
 porting are several isolation features of PouchContainer's. We will mostly
  introduce on hypervisor-based container technology by kata-container/runv
  on why we choose it\, how we support it\, what we achieve via it. This is
  fitable for those who are seeking strong-isolation solutions on container
  ecosystem\, and who are finding practical ways to adopt fancy cloud nativ
 e technologies in their legacy IT datacenters. What's more\, a demo of sup
 porting katacontainer/runV in PouchContainer and running a legacy applicat
 ion on old kernels will be presented.

DESCRIPTION:Placement in OpenStack carries two fundamental issues that lim
 it its scalability. First\, Nova scheduler is too slow for large clouds\, 
 as it requires full knowledge of the system's state for its decisions. Sec
 ond\, the orchestration engine (Heat) enables launching multi-VM cloud app
 lications\, but deploys them one at a time since Nova lacks the required a
 pplication level awareness. This may lead to under-utilization and sub-opt
 imal performance.\nThis session addresses both issues. We will show a fast
 er alternative to Nova scheduler and an enhancement for application level 
 deployment. Through extensive evaluation on real datasets\, we will show t
 hat the new scheduler achieves up to x5.3 faster placements with similar q
 uality.  We will also show that our enhancement improves the performance 
 and acceptance ratio of network services.

DESCRIPTION:Continous integration jobs can generate massive volumes of dat
 a. When a job fails\, figuring out what went wrong can be a tedious proces
 s—one that involves investigating logs and discovering the root cause\, 
 often found in a fraction of the total job output.\nIn this workshop\, we
 ’ll show attendees how machine learning can help solve the challenge of 
 anomaly detection in job logs and save time in finding a failure’s root 
 cause. We’ll also demo Zuul v3 and how it can be extended to integrate l
 og processing models. Based on a live dataset of Zuul jobs\, attendees wil
 l use the log-classify project to build a machine learning model and autom
 atically extract anomalies. The workshop organizer will provide instructio
 ns and answer any questions\, but attendees are encouraged to contribute t
 o the discussion.

DESCRIPTION:Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides the ability to define
  an ordered list of network services (e.g.\, firewalls or load balancers)\
 , and then these services are stitched together to create a service chain.
  In Tacker\, OpenStack and Kubernetes can be used as VIMs for Virtual Mach
 ine and Container based VNFs respectively\, and TOSCA-based VNFFG can defi
 ne the service chain in a VM-based VIM like OpenStack or in a container-ba
 sed VIM like Kubernetes. This session talks about the challenges of implem
 enting the SFC support for mixed type VNFs (VM and container) to create th
 e service chain. It also covers the basic software architecture and talks 
 about the new feature with a demonstration.

DESCRIPTION:Two critical DNS gaps occur within traditional NFV and contain

 ks. In this demo\, Infoblox will highlight how Carrier-grade DNS and IP ad
 dress management (IPAM) closes these gaps. Infoblox helps speed deployment
 s and improve visibility by automating provisioning and discovery of dynam
 ic virtual and container resources by integrating in your orchestration an
 d ONAP processes. Even though security is top of mind for every telco and 
 organization across the world\, security holes for DNS are still a major c
 oncern. Over 95% of tested organizations allowed data exfiltration via DNS
  tunnels because existing tools allow open DNS communications. In this dem

 re importantly\, how to stop this risk.

DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes make container easier to deploy\, manage and scale.
  However\, using Kubernetes on OpenStack still requires users to manage th
 e underlying infrastructure such as a cluster of virtual servers. Users ar
 e responsible for the initial capacity planning\, such as deciding the clu
 ster size\, as well as the maintenance of the running clusters.\nThe emerg
 ing of serverless container technologies or solutions such as Amazon Web S
 ervice (AWS) Fargate\, Azure Container Instance (ACI) and OpenStack Zun pr
 ovide a viable alternative to run containers on the cloud. The serverless 
 approach allows users to run containers without having to pre-create or ma
 nage their own clusters.\nIn this presentation\, we will talk about how we
  adopt the serverless approach. We will leverage Kubernetes as the orchest
 ration layer and make Kubernetes provision &ldquo\;serverless&rdquo\; cont
 ainers using OpenStack Zun. This approach allows us to use Kubernetes with
  zero server management.

 and alone storage management interface. Today\, Cinder can be used not jus
 t in OpenStack\, but in container environments such as Kubernetes. It can 
 be used as a scriptable interface for devops tooling and automation. And w

 bernetes\, difficulties surrounding common issues such as authentication a
 nd policy enforcement multiply as OpenStack and Kubernetes have different 
 ecosystems. In the case of policy decision point\, OpenStack leverages key
 stone and oslo.policy\, while Kubernetes provides mechanism to use externa
 l policy engine.\nThis talk proposes a proof of concept to leverage a sing
 le external policy decision point (PDP) engine that would centralize PDP f
 or both OpenStack and Kubernetes. Effort to leverage external system such 
 as Apache Fortress was considered\, but the introduction of java to both O
 penStack's python code base and Kubernetes's golang code base proved chall
 enging. This talk proposes an alternative solution: Open Policy Agent (htt
 p://www.openpolicyagent.org/). As this is designed with cloud native envir
 onment in mind\, this can be adapted by oslo.policy to centralize policy-b
 ased control.

DESCRIPTION:Containers are increasingly being used to deploy applications\
 , and with good reason - given their portability\, simple scalability and 
 lower management burden. But there’s one myth worth clearing up - contai
 ners do not provide an impermeable security boundary\, nor do they aim to.
 If you want to run untrusted code in containers\, how can you ensure it do
 esn’t affect other workloads? How should you set yourself up for multite
 nancy?In this talk\, you’ll learn about security boundaries\, the isolat
 ion currently provided at each construct in a containerized system\, and n
 ew projects that you can start using for stronger isolation requirements.

  one step further into the virtualization and orchestration of different n
 etwork elements\, including radio and network processing components\, such
  as BBUs\, EPCs\, load balancers\, SDN controllers\, and others. To take a
 dvantage of the mobile/edge network possibilities\, and enable the require
 d flexibility to instantiation services on the fly anywhere on the network
  (core\, aggregation or edge) we proposed to use both OpenStack and Kubern
 etes at VIM level\, with Kuryr as the glue enabling both deployment models
 . As we integrate several network layers and orchestrators we have had to 
 integrate several network layers: Neutron\, Kubernetes\, Kuryr and orchest
 rators (ManageIQ\, OSM\, Tacker...). This session will go along and explai
 n all the interactions between them and how Kuryr can be used as a common

DESCRIPTION:The Magnum service brings container orchestration to OpenStack
 \, allowing OpenStack users to get a turnkey Kubernetes\, Mesos or Docker 
 Swarm cluster set up and ready to host containers with a simple REST call 
 to the Magnum API. At least that would be the case in an ideal world. In o

 examine the idealized life cycle of a Magnum cluster\, from the initial RE
 ST call to the point where the user retrieves the access credentials for t
 he finished cluster. We will follow the cluster through Magnum and the Ope
 nStack components involved in building it as it takes shape and examine th

 n the second part we will provide troubleshooting advice on various parts 
 of the cluster creation process that commonly fail. This part will cover b

DESCRIPTION:We will share our story of CI/CD transformation of 1000s of le

 tical but it still remains a hard problem many enterprises struggle with. 
 We will present lessons learned in the process of achieving new levels of 
 automation on OpenStack. \nCanary upgrades and Blue/Green deployment are t
 he two commonly used patterns to implement continuous delivery. In Canary 
 upgrades\, a small portion of the production traffic is sent to the new ve
 rsion under test. In blue/green deployments\, all the traffic is switched 
 to the new version and programmatically switched back in case the evaluati
 on fails.\nWe will show how to fully automate above steps to achieve true 
 continuous delivery in OpenStack using Ansible and LBaaS. We will show how
  to use analytics to express and automate application evaluation and ML ba
 sed traffic switching without any downtime.

 d Cloud\, and the Open Research Cloud Alliance (ORCA)\, to develop support
  for general cloud federation\, and enable a wide range of collaborative a
 pplication domains at any level in the software stack: IaaS\, PaaS\, or Sa
 aS.Background The momentum around cloud federation continues to grow. The 
 NIST/IEEE Joint WG on Federated Cloud [1\,2\,3] has been running for almos
 t seven months now\, and recently held their first workshop [4] to report-
 out on current work and invite stakeholders to review\, comment\, help in 
 charting the course of future work. The Open Research Cloud Alliance [5] h
 as been actively developing consensus across the scientific community stak
 eholders and will be holding their 4th Open Research Cloud Congress at the
  Vancouver Summit. The Open Geospatial Consortium will also be kicking-off
  their Testbed-14 [6] project in April which has a federated cloud task to
  demonstrate specific geospatial data sharing scenarios. This Forum topic 
 will continue the discussion around cloud federation started at the OpenSt
 ack Summit Forum in Sydney [7\,8]. Keystone\, OpenStack and the OpenStack 
 community are in a unique position to take a leadership position and make 
 significant contributions to this process. Keystone has already built-out 
 basic support to "federate-in" identities and "federate-out" OpenStack ser
 vices. With modest additional capabilities Keystone could support general 
 federations across multiple administrative domains [9] at any level in the
  system stack\, i.e.\, IaaS\, Paas\, and SaaS. This would facilitate a wid
 e variety of collaborations\, including areas as diverse as international 
 "big science" collaborations\, international disaster response\, and suppl
 y chain management\, just to name a few. This discussion session will cent
 er around possible federation deployment and governance models that could 
 be built-out in Keystone that embody the key concepts and design principle
 s being developed in the NIST/IEEE Joint WG and ORCA. The success of these
  efforts will depend directly on engaging with cloud builders\, operators\
 , and stakeholders. We welcome the opportunity to pursue this goal with th
 e OpenStack community.\n[1] Press Release: http://standards.ieee.org/news/

SUMMARY:Closing the Loop between ONAP and OpenStack for the Resilience of 
 Network Services

UID:20703@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:NFV deployment is a multi-layered stack where a unified Orches
 trator such as ONAP takes the responsibility of closed-loop automation for
  the resilience of virtual network function (VNF). The closed-loop should 
 be event driven for both efficiency and accuracy. The closed-loop is trigg
 ered by some symptom usually coming from given alert or event.  Once trig
 gered\, a predefined policy is used to connect the symptom with proper rec
 over operations which is a status machine relying on events too. So\, the 
 design of event driven framework becomes the key of closed loop. VNFs are 
 often deployed and running on OpenStack for its rich resource management f
 unctions and API. To transfer the events from OpenStack to ONAP\, we need 
 to weave together various message bus systems and event sources. In this p
 resentation\, we will share an innovated framework which federates the eve
 nts/alerts/metrics across different layers and sources with a demo of clos
 ed-loop automation through typical NFV use cases.

  at a place other than where he or she actually exists\, and being able to
  interact with the remote environment\, which may be real\, virtual\, or a
  combination of both. It is an advanced and emerging technology in robotic
 s\, which combines Virtual Reality\, Remote Sensing\, Real-time Communicat
 ion\, Cloud Networking\, Machine Learning\, Humanoid Robots together. With
  the rapid development of telecommunication\, especially 5G\, edge computi
 ng\, IOT infrastructure\, telexistence is becoming realistic and producibl
 e\, rather than cinematic concept or research topic.\nAs a startup company
  in telexistence\, we would love to share our knowledge and ideas about ho
 w to build a large-scale and distributed cloud networking control plane de
 dicated to telexistence in days. The most important point is that this SDN

 OS commands can be used\, not K8S commands. Fully isolated environments c

 ne clusters and supports it's own auth model\, but it also works using key
 stone for authentication. The combination of Swift with Keystone federatio
 n enables us to take advantage of swift's geographic scaling features as w
 ell as the ability to have access to our own and each others resources fro
 m across the globe.\nThis talk will cover the process of setting up federa

 grate to Cloud\, hardware acceleration has already become a necessity rath
 er than an interesting option. Cyborg provides the ability to manage accel

 ck projects like Nova or Neutron. We will then talk about how we utilized 
 Cyborg to manage accelerator resources like Netronome Network Card\, Xlinu
 x FPGA Card and Intel's QAT card. This particular section will cover what 
 we have done with Cyborg API\, Conductor\, drivers\, as well as Nova or Ne

DESCRIPTION:\nOne of the biggest promises of the cloud vision is the idea 
 that the infrastructure could be managed in a policy-driven fashion\, whic
 h could react to hard and soft failures and automatically heal and optimis
 e services.  Most of the components required for implementing such an arc
 hitecture already exist as OpenStack projects\; however there is not yet a
  clear strategy within the community for how these should all tie together
 .\n\n\nTo address this\, a new Self-Healing SIG (Special Interest Group) w
 as recently officially formed\, which aims to coordinate the use and devel
 opment of relevant OpenStack projects towards this vision.\n\n\nIn this ta
 lk\, we present an introductory overview of the SIG's goals and recent and
  future work. We also discuss how the capabilities of existing projects ca
 n contribute to a coherent self-healing infrastructure\, and explain how a
 nyone interested can join in the efforts to drive this vision forward.\n

UID:21801@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:OpenStack for Telco NFV Cloud deployment is rapidly gaining mo
 mentum\, however Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) are pushing the limits o
 n the network and demanding a feature rich high performance datapath. The 
 OpenStack\, Open vSwitch and Linux communities have upstreamed open APIs f
 or SmartNICs\, enabling high-throughput low-latency datapath with minimal 
 performance tuning and the ability to manipulate inner packet headers prov
 iding services like firewall DDoS protection\, Quality of Service (QoS) ma
 rking and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). These upstream integrated changes 
 are emerging in stable open source distros with no custom patches and no v
 endor lock-in\, supported by multiple SmartNIC vendors and SDN controllers
 . This is opening new flow processing possibilities\, while freeing up exp
 ensive CPU resources for running application workloads. In this session\, 
 we demonstrate out-of-the-box fast data path functional progress and perfo
 rmance results achieved with OpenStack SmartNICs running VNF workloads at 
 10/25/50/100G\, comparing vanilla OVS\, OVS over DPDK and Full OVS offload
 s. Notably\, our results run Nuage Networks Virtualized Cloud Services (SD
 N) on vanilla distros without kernel modifications or driver patches.

DESCRIPTION:Image management is the core of any infrastructure. As a servi
 ce provider or a consumer of infrastructure\, one needs a guarantee of the
  integrity of the image being used and ensure it is free from vulnerabilit
 ies. In situations of hybrid infrastructure\, it is challenging to ensure 
 the security and compliance policies are met uniformly across VMs\, contai
 ners\, and bare-metal images.  Also\, with growing workload needs of the h
 ybrid environment\, there&rsquo\;s a need for pre-baked application ready 
 images to reduce provisioning time.\nAs a solution to above challenges\, w
 e will demonstrate a framework\, capable of creating pre-packaged applicat
 ion images for containers\, bare-metal\, and VMs along with scanning them 
 for CVE&rsquo\;s.

 ntegrate multiple OpenStack deployments into core SP networks where OpenSt
 ack simply becomes part of the network.\nIn this presentation we will cove
 r various options and architectures for integrating OpenStack into a large
 r network\, from Neutron BGP dynamic routing to full blown SDN based solut
 ions. We will further cover why core networks\, often based on MPLS\, need
  to be considered by the OpenStack community\, specifically how they relat
 e to the potential requirement of Network Slicing in 5G deployments.\nWe w
 ill also cover how to simulate a core MPLS network with multiple OpenStack
  clouds\, including simulating latency due to large geographic distances (
 such as what one might find in Canada).

SUMMARY:Aptomi - application delivery engine for Kubernetes
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180523T185000Z

UID:21832@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Aptomi (https://github.com/Aptomi/aptomi/) is an open-source p
 roject that simplifies roll-out and operation of container-based applicati
 ons on Kubernetes. It introduces a service-centric abstraction\, allowing 
 dev teams to compose applications from multiple components connected toget
 her (components can be packaged via Helm\, k8s YAMLs\, ksonnet\, or define
 d in any other Kubernetes-friendly way)\n \nOnce service is defined\, you
  can run it across multiple envs (dev\, stage\, prod)\, k8s clusters\, as 
 well as control its lifecycle and updates. Service owners can very efficie
 ntly manage multiple instances of their service\, without having to deal w
 ith multiple copies of YAMLs and lower-level component configuration.\n \
 nAptomi also provides provides visibility for application owners\, allowin
 g to visualize dependencies and impact of changes. When you have hundreds 
 and thousands of containers running on k8s\, it may be difficult to unders
 tand which applications they belong to\, who owns them\, why they were cre
 ated\, what is no longer in use\, and the impact of changes. Aptomi solves
  that problem with its UI for contextualized visibility.

DESCRIPTION:This session is to discuss the current operational issues for 
 DPDK\, SR-IOV in NFV environments and the way forward. This came out from 
 the discussions from NFV track in OpsMeetup Tokyo.https://etherpad.opensta
 ck.org/p/TYO-ops-meetup-2018-sriov-dpdk Current NFV application requires h
 igh throughput and need some accerelation technology (or is reqiured to ru
 n VNF applications). OVS-DPDK and SR-IOV are the major options chosen toda
 y. However\, there are limitations for both\, such as DPDK can't make enog
 h throuput and occupies many CPU cores\, SR-IOV is fast but loses flexibil
 ity (e.g. can't migrate VM\, HW lock-in). How can we best address those is
 sues(not a workaround but the ideal goal) and how can the community lead t
 o that direction?\nWhat are the "real" requirements from telcos?\nImprove 
 DPDK using NIC offload? Understand the current status.\nImprove SR-IOV to 
 be more flexible or use other solution?\nVNF applications should change?\n
 Telcos should change?\n This may not be OpenStack only discussion\, but se
 emed important for NFV stakesholders to understand the current limitations
  and make technical decision on deploying NFV environments. We need to hav
 e telcos and VNF vendors in the room to make discussion fruitful. Moderato

DESCRIPTION:Cloud Edge computing use cases range from IoT to VR/AR and any
  widely distributed application in between.  However\, taking OpenStack ou
 t of the data center requires an entirely new approach to security when th
 ere is far less ability to restrict access and often the applications requ
 ire a shared tenant model. Some of the factors that need to be considered 
 include:\n\nMore stringent requirements for infrastructure software (code/
 design) in exposed environments\nNew ways of thinking about RBAC at the co
 ntrol interfaces\nConflicts arising from shared ownership and divided resp
 onsibilities for devices/systems/applications\nManaging lifecycle operatio
 ns and deployments over insecure WAN connections\nDifferent ways of lookin
 g at tenant spaces in remote locations\nImposing network/compute/storage/m
 emory separation from the underlying virtualization/hardware components\nM
 anaging security over intermittent WAN connections\nSecuring semi-autonomo
 us and self-managed locations\n

 top of it. By having this\, the application is able to keep zero downtime 
 with its service during the operations as well as to be able to utilize ne
 w capabilities of the upgraded underlying compute nodes. Not only the appl
 ication benefits from this\, but also the infrastructure admin\, as he can
  even request to down scale the application. That is\, for rolling upgrade
 s in networking systems where there may not be sufficient resources to per
 form rolling upgrade\, e.g. due to strict Return on Investment (ROI) polic
 y for the special Telco hardware used. Using the proposed framework\, you 
 can first down scale the application to free capacity on your hardware for
  then triggering the rolling upgrade. Presentation shows how this and much
  more will be accomplished.

SUMMARY:Low-overhead tracing using eBPF for observability into container a

UID:21134@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:In the Container world\, there is a need to build observabilit
 y around apps and backing services running in containers.\nThe observabili
 ty should allow to capture on demand low level metrics at a low overhead.\
 nThe proposal is to use ebpf as the tracing technology to capture details 
 at kernel & user level\, and generate on demand flamegraphs\, heat maps fo
 r applications & backing services.\nThe Linux kernel has a built-in BPF JI
 T compiler\, and an in-kernel verifier which is used to validate eBPF prog
 rams. This allows user defined instrumentation on a live kernel image that
  can never crash\, hang or interfere with the kernel negatively. eBPF prov
 ides in-kernel implementation of storage maps such as histograms and hash-
 maps\, which helps in efficient copy of summarized monitoring data from ke
 rnel to user space with low overhead.\nThese features make eBPF programs s
 afe to run in production and allow admins and engineers to collect crucial
  data from systems for performance analysis and monitoring.

DESCRIPTION:With the usage of edge clouds\, it will be possible to run ban
 dwidth hungry applications with low latency and ensure significant cost sa
 vings.The cloud will evolve into a distributed network of clouds which are
  connected to each other and holistically managed. Applications can be acc
 elerated by increased responsiveness and maximized interactivity from the 
 edge. Real-time analytics can be performed at the point of capture and cor
 rective actions\, can be taken locally.The ETSI MEC group has specified th
 e architecture\, interfaces and APIs for a distributed application platfor
 m. The MEC specifications aim to stimulate innovation and promote interope
 rability and deployment. They enable rapid service creation and delivery\,
  efficient and intelligent orchestration and flexible exposure of network 
 and context information. In this presentation we will discuss the MEC requ
 irements for the infrastructure and show how an OpenStack based edge host 
 can fulfill these requirements.

 mme to enable end to end interoperability testing among different VNFs\, M
 ANO solutions and NFV Platforms. The initiative has been joined by 48 orga
 nizations and is supported by multiple open source communities\, including
  OpenStack\, which is at the core of  many of the platforms participating 
 to the testing. This presentation will outline the organization of the Plu
 gtests by the ETSI CTI and the NFV TST Working Group: the technical challe
 nges\, the test plans\, and the results achieved so far\, which give a gre

DESCRIPTION:Keystone has long been the barrier blocking cloud-native appli
 cations from truly automation-compatible support. Applications\, deploymen
 t tools\, and OpenStack services have all required dedicated keystone user
 s whose passwords are committed to configuration files. This talk introduc
 es Application Credentials\, a new feature in the Queens release of keysto
 ne that enables applications and automation to authenticate with keystone 
 without requiring a dedicated keystone user\, allows graceful rotation of 
 credentials with minimal downtime\, and encourages restrictive permissions
  delegation to applications.

DESCRIPTION:Tencent has started using OpenStack since 2012. We develop and
  maintain our own cloud management system TStack based on OpenStack. This 
 presentation shows TStack’s new roadmap including 3 objectives: usabilit
 y\, openness and flexibility. For usability\, TStack has been refactored b
 y micro-service architecture to enable CI/CD. OpenStack has already enable
 s its Kubernetes deployment with Helm and Kolla. As a cloud management sys
 tem\, TStack has also been refactored into containers and orchestrated by 
 Kubernetes. We firstly share our feedbacks about this refactoring. OpenSta
 ck is considered as an ecosystem to integrate upper PaaS and SaaS to impro
 ve openness. IaaS is considered as a base for the whole cloud ecosystem. T
 encent has developed a rich portfolio of PaaS and SaaS. Thanks to the refe
 rence architecture and standard interfaces of OpenStack\, we can easily in
 tegrate PaaS and SaaS based on OpenStack. Horizontally\, flexibility is ac
 hieved by combining both Tencent public cloud and TStack private cloud res
 ources in a hybrid mode. With the modern usage of cloud\, e.g. edge comput
 ing\, the frontier between the public cloud and private cloud becomes dyna
 mic\, an application can be easily migrate from a private cloud to a publi
 c cloud or vice versa. Tencent also builds such a dynamic hybrid cloud sol
 ution based on its public and private cloud.

DESCRIPTION:Network Functionality Virtualization is gaining huge traction 
 in telco industry as it offers faster service enablement and cost savings 
 in deploying Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Telco providers have to mee
 t service availability at 99.999% (Carrier-grade). Most of the VNFs are pa
 ckaged and run on virtual machines. However containers with Kubernetes as 
 orchestration engine is becoming more popular because of increased agility
 \, reduced footprint and auto-scaling capabilities.\nThough containers has
  become a viable alternative to virtual machines\, there are significant g
 aps to meet carrier grade requirements for network functions in containers
 .  This talk presents how to operate Kubernetes on OpenStack and provide
  the following key capabilities:\nMulti-tenancy with resource guarantees\n
 Multiple network interfaces which is a basic need for functions such as fi
 rewall\nData acceleration to give high throughput and low latency\nEnhance

DESCRIPTION:We have previously shown how OPNFV Barometer (Platform Service
  Assurance) can facilitate the adoption of NFV by providing the critical p
 latform and NFVI metrics required to detect and correct faults before serv
 ice outages occur.\nOutside of SA\, Barometer has proven quite useful by p
 roviding standardized metric sets for different applications fulfilling a 
 variety of purposes e.g.\, benchmarking\, Intelligent orchestration\, SUT 
 characterization/analysis\, etc\nThe OPNFV Bottlenecks project simulates e
 xtreme or long term product usage to verify if the SUT could survive to m
 eet some quality requirements which are based on the monitoring metrics.\n
 The OPNFV Yardstick project has made use of these same metrics in network 
 services benchmarking and for VNF characterization.\nThis talk will show h
 ow Barometer can be used in conjunction with Bottlenecks and Yardstick to 
 fulfill use cases beyond service assurance to further ease the transition 
 to NFV by promoting standardization and interoperability.

DESCRIPTION:Upgrading directly from Juno to Ocata is something the OpenSta

 it with almost zero impact on our customers. A key piece of this task was 
 running five database migrations across three components (Nova\, Glance\,

 migration was the re-imaging of almost 1\,000 HVs to upgrade the OS and Li
 bvirt\, and also migrating our custom patches and plugins to work with the
  Ocata code base. During this entire process\, any given VM was only down 
 for a few hours during the HV upgrade\, while the Nova API had even less d
 owntime. We are currently expanding on this work for the Juno to Ocata upg
 rade of Ironic and Neutron in our Bare Metal clusters and will publish det

DESCRIPTION:Deep learning(DL)\, High-Performance Computing(HPC)\, Big Data

 U and GPU-GPU. At the same time\, rapid enhancement of GPGPU programming i
 s required but its so complicated. We know utilizing OpenACC and CUDA Unif
 ied Memory will be helpful to reduce programming complexity but it require
 s more cost between CPU and GPU.So we choose IBM Power server with the ful
 l NVLink connectivity between CPU and GPU which efficiently reduces these 
 costs as possible. It also has high bandwidth path between CPU and GPU tha
 n PCIe Gen3 x16.Our main aim is to provide private cloud as in-house servi
 ce within our company after integrating IBM Power server to our internal O
 penStack environment. Then\, comparison is made among IBM Power servers wi

UID:21536@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Beyond OpenStack for IT\, NFV is another killer use case. Hori
 zontally\, multiple NGPoPs (OpenStack deployments) are geographically dist
 ributed but should be centrally controlled. Vertically\, users of cross-la
 yer services like bare-metal\, IaaS\, VNF and/or SDN should be federated. 
 Hence\, Identity and Access Management (IAM) module becomes a key issue.\n
 The proposed solution enables dynamic policy reconfiguration instead of st
 atic OSLO policy.json and enables external PDP to manage multiple OpenStac
 k deployments for NFV NGPoPs. The organization of this PDP contains a set 
 of upstreamed hooks to OpenStack/OSLO\, OpenDaylight/AAA\, and possibly Tu
 ngsten Fabric in the future. It also proposed a reference implementation o
 f the security engine policy called Moon hosted by the OPNFV community.\nO
 range as major Telco operator is planning the deployment in production of 
 this “external PDP mechanism” in 2019 for its first VNFs\, in collabor
 ation with the upstream community and Red Hat.

 one else\, and was the response to the threat sufficient to meet the chall
 enge? • Security groups in OpenStack: useful innovation or a critical c

 ck? • OpenStack security checkup? What are the roadmap priorities with 
 respect to security? • Vulnerabilities on the horizon: where should we 
 place our priorities as a community of developers? • What priorities sh
 ould users have for hardening their security: the application level (user 
 workloads) or the organization level (formal agreements with cloud users t
 o address cloud privacy\, security\, and reliability)? • What role\, if
  any\, do GDPR and other regulatory influences play in OpenStack security 
 considerations?\nIf you follow Sean\, you know he asks tough\, focused and

 nt of the VM.  Recent work  in the OpenStack Masakari project has start
 ed to look at leveraging a simple standardized  API between an OpenStack
  compute host and it's hosted Guest VMs. Such work enables  capabilities
  as 'active' / white-box type monitoring of the VM and Applications within
  the VM\,  graceful notifications of potentially service-affecting admin
 istrative commands on the VM\,  and even the ability to NACK these poten

  such an approach\, and provide a simple demo of these capabilities.

 ! But wait – how to provide the security functionality to meet the strin
 gent requirements regarding user data needed by that kind of applications.
  OpenStack will not do that for you out of the box!\nHelp is on its way.\n
 We developed an OpenStack extension that ensures confidentiality and integ
 rity of user data that is processed\, stored and exchanged between highly 
 distributed cloud components. It encrypts user data prior to cloud entry. 
 The encryption keys are managed by the OpenStack client. They are not stor

 status quo of OpenStack security regarding user data\, explain the concept
 s of our extension and present a live demo of our prototype to meet the st

DESCRIPTION:5G standards are designed to take advantage of virtualization 
 and edge computing. They are meant to adapt automatically to changes in de
 mand. The massively distributed clouds that result will be complex and th
 ere are many implementation decisions to make.\nThe scale of 5G network\, 
 the distribution of the control function\, reemphasize not just the need f
 or automation but also the benefits of AI and predictive analytics. \nAut
 omation will be built in multiple systems that have complementary but some
 time overlapping scope. Openstack is one of them. The variety of architect
 ures result in a variety of options.\nAutoscaling is a good example of suc
 h automation. Some of this logic will be built into the application layer 
 possibly by a specialized microservice. But some of it can be built at the
  network layer in some Master orchestrator such as ONAP. Still some may al
 so be built at the node level\, in the Virtual infrastructure manager or i

  other things to drive to a solution that solves business needs. Minimizin

 ritical to ensure that networking does not overwhelm the deployment.\nOpen
 NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol)is a much better alternative for connec
 tivity than multiple site to site VPN tunnels to form a mesh. It provides 
 a mechanism to enable a fully meshed network between the different endpoin
 ts using multipoint GRE and IPSec. A Routing protocol is used to exchange 
 Route information. The dynamic nature of the protocol minimizes configurat
 ion changes with changes to the topology. We share our experience along wi

DESCRIPTION:The advent of 5G will change the communications industry by en
 abling placement of high-bandwidth and low-latency mobile services at the 
 edge of the network. Additionally\, 5G will allow deployment of both virtu
 alized RAN (Radio Access Network) and CN (Core Network) at the Edge\, ther
 eby opening a way to expose many of these mobile services capabilities t
 hrough APIs.\nThese APIs will be used by the 3rd party applications such a
 s AR/VR\, IoT\, media etc. It is expected that the exposure of network AP
 Is at the Edge will drive further innovation.\nIn this presentation\, we w
 ill share:\nVarious architectural options for exposing APIs at the Edge to
  be consumed by both Telco and Web applications.\nHow OpenStack can be uti
 lized to deploy the various architectural options for exposing APIs?\nEdge
  cloud placement of analytics that will leverage local information in rea
 l-time.\nHow analytics at the Edge can be utilized to manage the distribut
 ed infrastructure by utilizing OpenStack\, Kubernetes etc.?\n\nWhat can I 
 expect to learn?\nThe audience is expected to gain the following from this
  presentation:\nVarious options for exposing mobility and network services
  APIs at the edge of the network.\nHow various network APIs can be consume
 d by the 3rd party application developers?\nManagement of context informat

DESCRIPTION:Access control plays a very important role for both the cloud 
 providers and tenants to make optimal use of the OpenStack Features. Today
  Role Based Access Control rules are fixed before deployment on an OpenSta
 ck instance into a datacenter. Any changes to these roles\, is a very manu
 al and tedious process that causes consistency issues across 100s of deplo
 yment and ends up in creating a snow flake deployment environment. Since g
 ranular roles are not available\, users are tend to be given privileged ro
 les. Higher privilege access causes a lot of issues including inadvertent 
 deletes\, access to  tenant data\, and other security issues. With Dynami
 c RBAC\, it provides the flexibility for Cloud Administrators to define st
 ringent RBAC rules in real time and apply/activate these roles immediately
  eliminating the need to the next deployment cycle and tightening any secu
 rity loop holes.

 rator’s mind. With the use of Ansible\, an agentless IT automation techn
 ology\, a system administrator can do just that.\nThe goal of this lab is 
 to provide a brief introduction to Ansible\, the usability of Ansible play
 books\, and then show how to leverage key Ansible modules to better manage
  and simplify OpenStack environments. These management playbooks will cons
 ist of typical administrative tasks such as:\nManaging Networks\nManaging 
 Instances\nManaging Resources\nThis lab is best suited for system and Open
 Stack administrators looking for ways to automate their day-to-day OpenSta
 ck administrative tasks\nLab Requirements:\n- A laptop with an SSH client 
 and a modern web browser.

DESCRIPTION:Openstack Microclouds is a project that aims to reduce the ent
 ry costs and simplify the process of transitioning to cloud technologies o
 f new clients\, by sharing geo-distributed controller nodes among multiple
  deployments. By leaving only the networking and compute functions to the 
 client\, we make the process of setting up a public cloud with highly avai
 lable controller nodes a simple task. Using technologies like Ansible and 
 Docker we are able to present each client with an isolated and independent
  OpenStack deployment\, making management of multiple deployments almost a
  trivial job.

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack adaptation towards microservice architecture with th
 e help of kubernetes has now shifted its focus from “Installing Openstac
 k to build your initial cloud” to “Managing the lifecycle of a cloud 
 – scale out\, upgrade and manage failures”. With this adaptation comes
  two key ingredients– Monitoring and Logging.\nThis talk will focus on h
 ow to successfully Monitor and Log your cluster resources with the help of
  OpenStack Helm - package manager for Kubernetes.\nTalk would be followed 
 by a demo showcasing some of the features and use cases.\nMonitoring – O
 penStack Helm + Prometheus + Grafana\nOS Layer – Global cpu usage\, Memo
 ry usage etc.\nKubernetes Layer – K8s Api health metrics\, ETCD performa
 nce metrics etc.\nOpenStack Layer – Resource utilization per project\, s
 ervice etc.\nLogging – OpenStack Helm + Fluentd + Elastic Search + Kiban
 a\nOS layer – syslog\, boot.log\, kern.log etc.\nKubernetes Layer – co
 ntainer Logs \nOpenStack Layer – OpenStack service Logs\n

DESCRIPTION:Did you know Designate was designed to provide a solid\, Highl
 y Availible\, DNS Zone and Record management system for OpenStack users?\n
 In this talk the speaker will cover the following:\n\nHow the Designate co
 mponents fit together\nHow to deploy Designate in a HA configuration\nHow 
 to deploy Designate in a secure configuration\nHow to ensure you have a go
 od Disaster Recovery option setup and running for Designate\nWhat Server P
 ools are\, and how they can be used\nHow you can deploy a globally distrib
 uted Designate data plane\nHow Designate allows secure end user mangement 
 of Reverse DNS for Floating IPs\n\nAll of the above will be demonstrated o
 n a running system\, and examples for configuration of the system examaine
 d.\nGraham Hayes is the PTL for the Designate project\, and has run produc
 tion Designate installs in Public Clouds\, and packaged Designate for use 
 in on premises private / hybrid clouds.

SUMMARY:Steps to Optimizing OpenStack Resource Utilization for VNFs: Tying
  OpenStack Services Together

DESCRIPTION:As the Verizon Wireless OpenStack Edge platform grows\, making
  efficient use of resources also grows in importance\, to deliver the cost
  benefits of OpenStack to Verizon customers. This presentation explores ho
 w utilization at the highest level\, Virtual Network Function (VNF) redund
 ancy pairs\, relates to utilizations at intermediate and lower levels. For
  example\, an intermediate level\, a nova server\, corresponds to a lower 
 level Libvirt instance\, which in turn is composed of CPU cores which each
  have utilizations. In some cases\, these CPU cores may be pinned by the V
 NF design\, and used at 100%\, in which case no optimization is possible. 
 In other cases\, some over-subscription may be possible without impacting 
 services. In addition to tying a given nova VM together with its foundatio
 nal levels\, each VNF frequently contains multiple nova instances\, neutro
 n networks\, and cinder volumes\, which also must be considered when over-
 subscribing.

DESCRIPTION:In this session we will talk something about OpenStack based H
 PC ecosystem which is currently running on TianHe-2 Super computer. Curren
 tly we have thousands of nodes running in production mainly used for simul
 ation\, analysis\, and government security applications. In order to get b
 est performance for compute intensive application\, LXC is used as virtual
 ization for OpenStack\, lots of optimizations have been made and some patc
 hes are added to kernel and nova to support features like volume based LXC
 \, GPU passthrough for better performance.\nThis session will focus on how
  we tuning/modify Openstack and Operating system for large scale HPC\, and
  what's we gained by running HPC on OpenStack.
