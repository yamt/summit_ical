DESCRIPTION:Airship is a collection of interoperable and loosely coupled o
 pen source tools that provide for automated cloud provisioning and life cy
 cle management in a completely declarative and predictable way. The focus 
 of this project is the implementation of a declarative platform to introdu
 ce OpenStack on Kubernetes\, and the lifecycle management of the resulting
  cloud. Airship achieves this by managing the lifecycle of the entire stac
 k\, from the baremetal infrastructure and network configuration\, to the D
 ocker configuration and Kubernetes cluster\, as well as OpenStack. It does
  this with the scale\, speed\, resiliency\, flexibility and operational pr
 edictability demanded of Network Clouds at scale.\nThis presentation provi
 des an overview of the Airship project and its recent transition to the Op
 enStack foundation. You can expect to learn what services and components m
 ake up the Airship project as well as how they work together to provide de
 clarative and predictable lifecycle management for your cloud and the adva
 ntages this brings for operators. We will review how this is leveraged tod
 ay by several companies and how you can get started using and contributing
  to the project.\nAt its core\, the Airship project has four main objectiv
 es:\nBE DECLARATIVE Sites are declared using YAML. This includes both hard
  assets such as network configuration and bare metal hosts as well as soft
  assets like helm charts\, their overrides\, and container images. You man
 age the document and Airship implements it.\nONE WORKFLOW FOR LIFE CYCLE M
 ANAGEMENT We needed a system that was predictable with life cycle manageme
 nt at its core. This meant ensuring we had one workflow that handled both 
 initial deployments as well as future site updates. In other words\, there
  should be virtually nothing different when interacting with a new deploym
 ent or providing an an update to an existing site.\nCONTAINERS AS THE NEW 
 UNIT OF SOFTWARE DELIVERY Containers are the unit of software delivery for
  Airship. Everything is a container. This allows us to predictably promote
  hermetically sealed containers from development\, to testing\, and finall
 y production with confidence.\nFLEXIBLE FOR DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES AND SO
 FTWARE Airship is delivering environments both very small and large with a
  wide range of configurations. We use Airship to manage our entire cloud p
 latform\, not just OpenStack.

DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes and Helm allow for near-effortless deployment and m
 anagement of resilient resources.  This talk will discuss bringing simila
 r ease to test automation in a container-orchestrated context.\nOpenStack-
 Helm (OSH) is a Helm chart library that allows simple customization and de
 ployment of OpenStack containers across k8s clusters\, from laptop-scale t
 o data center-scale.  As OSH matures\, it integrates robust and seamless 
 testing via Tempest and Rally functionality.  OSH leverages these tools i
 n multiple contexts\, from lightweight "helm test" validation to full-blow
 n Helm charts with customizable container overrides.\nThis talk will provi
 de an overview of the OSH QA integration as currently implemented\, as wel
 l as our vision for containerized testing efforts in the future. We hope i
 t will serve as an informative talk as well as a collaboration point betwe
 en others in the community to ultimately make containerized testing effort
 s as functional/robust/useful as possible.

DESCRIPTION:Delegation allows a user to let someone or something else perf
 orm operations on her behalf.  Delegation is the the key to scaling.    In
  order to delegate\, you have to make use of the access control mechanisms
  of your automation.Both Keystone and Kubernetes have Role Based Access Co
 ntrol (RBAC).  While there is\, as of yet\, no interoperability between th
 em.  There is also no attempt to support the applications running on top o
 f them.  In this presentation\, we'll go through the RBAC mechanisms of bo
 th layers\, and then discuss how to extend a unified view of RBAC to the e

DESCRIPTION:Containers provide a compelling alternative virtualization for
  modern application development. OpenShift running on OpenStack allows com
 bining the exposition of resources in the infrastructure layer such as net
 work\, compute and storage\, provided by OpenStack\, with in the consumpti
 on of these resources from the platform side by OpenShift. One of the many
  benefits of running OpenShift on OpenStack is the ability to deploy conta
 iners on bare metal using OpenStack Ironic. Different applications have va
 rying performance requirements\, many of them benefiting from running on b
 are metal. The density of containers per node and the scalability of bare 
 metal nodes hosting containers can be orchestrated by OpenShift and OpenSt
 ack Bare Metal. In this session you will learn how OpenShift Container Pla
 tform is used with Red Hat OpenStack Platform and its Bare Metal service\,
  maximizing container performance and application scalability in the priva
 te cloud.

 penStack Magnum to expand the available capacity to external clouds\, whil
 e still offering a single entrypoint to our users - using GKE\, AKS\, Amaz
 on and other clouds. We will cover the internals of the federation integra
 tion in Magnum\, and some of the issues we had (mainly networking) and how
  we solved them. We will present how these deployments simplify the integr

DESCRIPTION:Wouldn’t it be cool if there was a way to have 3rd party ven
 dor drivers to have a way to build their own Kolla based containers? In th
 is talk\, we propose a framework where 3rd party vendor drivers are built 
 as a layer on top of Kolla’s core containers. This solution allows vendo
 rs to determine how their containers are built and managed while continuin
 g to stay out-of-tree. With this solution\, OpenStack operators can still 
 utilize the power of Kolla’s installer infrastructure to install these c
 ontainers and also integrate into its configuration framework. The solutio
 n does not involve using OpenStack CI to build these 3rd party container 
 images.\nIn this talk\, we will explain the best practices to containerize
  OpenStack vendor plugins and use vendor hardware or vendor NFV and use 3r
 d-party CI to gate them with OpenStack using Kolla and do a cool demo at t
 he end!\n Bring your hardware\, and we'll conainerize its plugins for Ope

DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes make container easier to deploy\, manage and scale.
  However\, using Kubernetes on OpenStack still requires users to manage th
 e underlying infrastructure such as a cluster of virtual servers. Users ar

 ster size\, as well as the maintenance of the running clusters.\nThe emerg
 ing of serverless container technologies or solutions such as Amazon Web S
 ervice (AWS) Fargate\, Azure Container Instance (ACI) and OpenStack Zun pr
 ovide a viable alternative to run containers on the cloud. The serverless 
 approach allows users to run containers without having to pre-create or ma
 nage their own clusters.\nIn this presentation\, we will talk about how we
  adopt the serverless approach. We will leverage Kubernetes as the orchest
 ration layer and make Kubernetes provision &ldquo\;serverless&rdquo\; cont
 ainers using OpenStack Zun. This approach allows us to use Kubernetes with

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack is currently the best available option for building 
 private clouds\, with the ability to manage networking\, storage and compu
 te infrastructure\, with support for virtual machines\, bare-metal\, and c
 ontainers from one control plane. While Kubernetes is arguably the most po
 pular container orchestrator and has changed application delivery\, it dep
 ends on the availability of a solid cloud infrastructure\, and OpenStack o
 ffers the most comprehensive open source infrastructure for hosting applic
 ations. OpenStack’s multi-tenant cloud infrastructure is a natural fit f
 or Kubernetes\, with several integration points\, deployment solutions\, a
 nd ability to federate across multiple clouds.In this talk\, we’re going
  to explore how containers work within OpenStack\, examine various use cas
 es\, and provide an overview of open source projects\, from OpenStack and 
 elsewhere\, that help make containers a technology that’s easily adopted
  and utilized.

DESCRIPTION:MetalK8s is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution with a focu

 ko solution in customer datacenters.It is based on the Kubespray project t
 o reliably install a base Kubernetes cluster\, including all dependencies 
 (like etcd)\, using the Ansible provisioning tool. This installation is fu
 rther augmented with operational tools for monitoring and metering\, inclu
 ding Prometheus\, Grafana\, ElasticSearch and Kibana. Furthermore\, an "in
 gress controller" is deployed by default\, based on Nginx. All of these ar
 e managed as Helm packages.Unlike hosted Kubernetes solutions\, where netw
 ork-attached storage is available and managed by the provider\, we assume 
 no such system to be available in environments where MetalK8s is deployed.
  As such\, we focus on managing node-local storage\, and exposing these vo

DESCRIPTION:The Magnum service brings container orchestration to OpenStack
 \, allowing OpenStack users to get a turnkey Kubernetes\, Mesos or Docker 
 Swarm cluster set up and ready to host containers with a simple REST call 
 to the Magnum API. At least that would be the case in an ideal world. In o
 ur world\, the key does not always turn. And if it does\, the (Heat) engin
 e driving Magnum may sputter and die. In the first part\, we will closely 
 examine the idealized life cycle of a Magnum cluster\, from the initial RE
 ST call to the point where the user retrieves the access credentials for t
 he finished cluster. We will follow the cluster through Magnum and the Ope
 nStack components involved in building it as it takes shape and examine th
 e roles the individual services play in creating the cluster bit by bit. I
 n the second part we will provide troubleshooting advice on various parts 
 of the cluster creation process that commonly fail. This part will cover b

 how an example of a VNF implementation based on VMs and containers. Variou
 s solutions have been proposed for this challenge. Some solutions use Mag
 num\, Kuryr\, Fuxi\, or Zun to solve management and networking issues\, bu
 t create strong linkage to OS. Others manage containers at VM level\, so 
 OS commands can be used\, not K8S commands. Fully isolated environments c
 ould use one OS platform for cloud native\, container only platforms and a
 nother for VMs\, connecting them by a VNF with both containers and VMs\, o
 r with an SDN controller for the networking part. Our option allows VNFs 
 to be developed for hybrid environments\, where installation is based on O
 S and networking uses Calico BGP to distribute Neutron networks to contain
 er domain.We address lifecycle management\, including installation\, manag
 ement\, networking and root cause analysis in the hybrid world.

 lise Fission\,  an open source\, serverless framework built on Kubernetes!
  We have built a Heat module for Fission that will give you the ability to
  use your favorite programing/scripting language (Python\, NodeJS\, Go\, C

DESCRIPTION:Currently in a datacenter everyone has containers managed by K
 ubernetes and also Openstack as a IAAS platform . we need a unified way to
  making sure that these kinda of hybrid setup can works on same network . 
 Project Calico help us to bridge that gap . Calico provides a pure L3 fab
 ric solution for interconnecting Virtual Machines or Linux Containers (“
 workloads”). Instead of a vSwitch\, Calico employs a vRouter function in
  each compute node.From Kubernetes to OpenStack\, AWS to GCE\, Calico sup
 ports all of major cloud providers.\nBefore coming to the session\, Please

 some workloads on it like the AnyConnect and RHOSP-Director to see possibi
 lities and limits of this approach. This lab is not for deploying producti

  the rapid development of telecommunication\, especially 5G\, edge computi
 ng\, IOT infrastructure\, telexistence is becoming realistic and producibl

 w to build a large-scale and distributed cloud networking control plane de
 dicated to telexistence in days. The most important point is that this SDN

 the distribution of the control function\, reemphasize not just the need f

 omation will be built in multiple systems that have complementary but some
 time overlapping scope. Openstack is one of them. The variety of architect
 ures result in a variety of options.\nAutoscaling is a good example of suc
 h automation. Some of this logic will be built into the application layer 
 possibly by a specialized microservice. But some of it can be built at the
  network layer in some Master orchestrator such as ONAP. Still some may al

 ress these questions.\nBefore proposing new pieces of software\, it is ess
 ential to conduct a gap analysis of the current code base. This talk prese
 nts the study carried within the FEMDC SiG.\nFirst\, we introduce capabili
 ties admins/users may expect - from the simplest\, start a VM at a specifi
 c location\; to the most advanced\, interoperability across cloud stacks. 
 Second\, we discuss how we evaluated the different deployment scenarios th
 at might be envisioned with the current OpenStack code base. We conclude b

DESCRIPTION:5G standards are designed to take advantage of virtualization 
 and edge computing. They are meant to adapt automatically to changes in de
 mand. The massively distributed clouds that result will be complex and th
 ere are many implementation decisions to make.\nThe scale of 5G network\, 
 the distribution of the control function\, reemphasize not just the need f
 or automation but also the benefits of AI and predictive analytics. \nAut
 omation will be built in multiple systems that have complementary but some
 time overlapping scope. Openstack is one of them. The variety of architect
 ures result in a variety of options.\nAutoscaling is a good example of suc
 h automation. Some of this logic will be built into the application layer 
 possibly by a specialized microservice. But some of it can be built at the
  network layer in some Master orchestrator such as ONAP. Still some may al
 so be built at the node level\, in the Virtual infrastructure manager or i
 n Openstack. \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Mentoring has always been a big part of the OpenStack Communit
 y and the time has come for changes. Historically\, the Women of OpenStack
  have owned and run the mentoring program that our community offers to new
  comers. However\, in order to reach a wider audience and to remove any th
 oughts that the program was women only\, we are looking to move the Long T
 erm Mentoring program out from under the Women of OpenStack to a new home.
  Potential groups that already exist that could own/help manage it are: Fi
 rst Contact SIG or Diversity WG.  In addition to a new overlord\, the form
 at of the program itself could use updates. Previously\, there was a 1 men
 tee to 1 mentor ratio that would often struggle for want of a defined goal
  and slow downs when the mentor would switch jobs or be on vacation. The p
 roposed new format will use cohorts to mentor community members and help t
 hem to would require fewer overall mentors helping mentees work towards a 
 defined common goal.  So what does this mean for you? We need one or more 
 volunteers to help get the new program off the ground and oversee the new 
 mentoring program. To be involved from the ground up- helping design what 
 it should look like\, what goals are\, recruiting mentors and mentees- and
  continuing to support the program into the future.

 \, volume (volume storage)\, or another resource?\n physical resource: net
 work (bandwith in host?)\, PCI-passthrough devices\, etc.\n How to create 
 a reservation and how to provision a reserved resource?\n Do users create 
 their reserved resource with reservation-id (this is a way the instance/ho
 st reservations do)?\n Does Blazar create their reserved resource at start
 _time and assign the resource to the user?\n Resource utilization\n  In ad
 dition\, we would like to receive feedback from Blazar operators about the
  current instance and host reservation features.

DESCRIPTION:Since its creation in early 2016\, within Nova\, there's alway
 s been a hope and plan that the Placement service would be extracted to it
 s own project and repository. Work has begun in Rocky to lay the groundwor
 k to make this possible\, but there is still plenty more that needs to be 
 done to make it happen\, including:\nGathering feedback from operators and
  deployers on their concerns and plans.\nDetailing the several options for
  managing data migrations.\nDetermining which of those are the best.\nMana
 ging standard resource classes (probably with an os-resource-classes libra
 ry in similar form to os-traits).\nFinishing up work on getting nova impor
 ts out of placement code.\nStrategies for managing functional and integrat
 ion tests in Nova and other clients of Placement.\nSee a related email to

DESCRIPTION:Now that the First Contact SIG is off the ground and getting m

 nd knowledge to help operators. Up until this point\, the majority of our 
 activities have been focused on helping out new contributors looking to do
  code development. Given that contribution encompasses all kinds of other 
 activities besides development\, we want to be a group that supports more 
 types of contribution. This discussion will begin with a state of the unio
 n on resources that exist for new contributors and where we have gaps in t
 hose resources. The goal of the session is to come out of discussions with
  a better feel for resources that exist to help support new contributors t
 hat are operators and garner involvement from more established operators i

DESCRIPTION:Over the past few year we've increasingly been relying on data
  analytics and automation to keep on track of our increasing number of CI 
 job results. With things like elastic recheck\, subunit2sql\, openstack-he
 alth\, and grafana we've got an increasing number of tools to track result
 s and provide insights into what's happening in the gate. But\, even with 
 all this data capture a great deal of the analysis has to happen by hand i
 n these systems. Either by identifying things to track or combing through 
 the data to find points of interest. It would be great if we could automat
 e as much of that as possible\, which is an a good application for machine
  learning. This session is about bootstraping a community effort to build 
 tooling to apply machine learning techniques to our CI results analysis to
  provide useful insights in an automated manner.

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180522T000000Z

DESCRIPTION:A recently proposed spec to Cinder suggests using a database t
 o avoid raciness when multiple schedulers are used in the Cinder environme
 nt. The described raciness is the result of each scheduler having an indep
 endent view of the available resources in the environment. This problem ca
 n be solved by having a single authoritative service for tracking resource
  inventory and usage. Placement does this. This session will bring Placeme
 nt and Cinder community members together to determine how Cinder can use P
 lacement. We will:\n Help Placement developers understand how scheduling c
 urrently works in Cinder.\n Help Cinder developers understand what Placeme
 nt can do.\n Develop short and medium term plans to get started with makin
 g it real.\n This session will also be great for other projects interested
  in learning how Placement can be leveraged for some of their needs\, and 
 hopefully provide an example of how to introduce Placement into their proj

DESCRIPTION:Cyborg is an emerging project\, dealing with accelerators such

 many players in the industry. It would benefit both Cyborg developers and 
 cloud/NFV operators to align on what is needed and what is planned to be d
 elivered\, not only for Rocky but also going forward. With that background
 \, we (Cyborg developers) propose to engage with the operators on the foll
 owing focus areas. Other topics are welcome to be added.\n What use cases 
 are the operators interested in\, and in what priority?What workloads and 
 bitstreams do they think is essential for a cloud FPGA service? \n Do they
  plan to develop their own IP to any extent\, or will rely on 3rd parties?
 \n For 3rd party bitstreams\, how do they plan to validate the bitstreams\
 , if at all?\n There is a train of thought that IP developers will hold th
 eir bitstreams confidential and not share with operators. OTOH\, operators
  may want to validate the bitstream first before even adding it to their r
 epo. What is their take?\nTheir top concerns/challenges and priorities\, a
 part from the above.\n

DESCRIPTION:This would be a session to get nova and neutron developers in 
 the same room with operators to discuss a few open issues and get feedback
  to move forward. Specifically:Bandwidth-based scheduling\nSpec: https://r
 eview.openstack.org/#/c/502306/ This is something that users have requeste
 d for awhile\, and was called out during the Foundation's marketing highli
 ghts for Rocky: https://youtu.be/Lt8EhrDg4lU?t=692 but it's pretty hairy a
 nd we need to make sure all stakeholders agree on the design.What to do ab
 out FQDNs and the dhcp_domain option Bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/
 +bug/1698010 There has been some discussion in the mailing list between de
 vs and operators already about this\, but no agreement on the plan to move
  forward or how people are dealing with FQDN and DNS in their clouds\, so 
 we need operator feedback before we can work on a solution.

DESCRIPTION:Dr. Craig A. Lee\, NIST/IEEE Joint Working Group on Federated 
 Cloud\, lee@aero.org Dr. Martial Michel\, Data Machines\, Inc.\, martialmi
 chel@datamachines.io Dr. Khalil Yazdi\, Yazdi and Associates Dr. Robert Bo
 hn\, National Institute of Standards and TechnologyPurpose Determine how t
 he OpenStack Community can partner with the NIST/IEEE Joint WG on Federate
 d Cloud\, and the Open Research Cloud Alliance (ORCA)\, to develop support
  for general cloud federation\, and enable a wide range of collaborative a
 pplication domains at any level in the software stack: IaaS\, PaaS\, or Sa
 aS.Background The momentum around cloud federation continues to grow. The 
 NIST/IEEE Joint WG on Federated Cloud [1\,2\,3] has been running for almos
 t seven months now\, and recently held their first workshop [4] to report-
 out on current work and invite stakeholders to review\, comment\, help in 
 charting the course of future work. The Open Research Cloud Alliance [5] h
 as been actively developing consensus across the scientific community stak
 eholders and will be holding their 4th Open Research Cloud Congress at the
  Vancouver Summit. The Open Geospatial Consortium will also be kicking-off
  their Testbed-14 [6] project in April which has a federated cloud task to
  demonstrate specific geospatial data sharing scenarios. This Forum topic 
 will continue the discussion around cloud federation started at the OpenSt
 ack Summit Forum in Sydney [7\,8]. Keystone\, OpenStack and the OpenStack 
 community are in a unique position to take a leadership position and make 
 significant contributions to this process. Keystone has already built-out 
 basic support to "federate-in" identities and "federate-out" OpenStack ser
 vices. With modest additional capabilities Keystone could support general 
 federations across multiple administrative domains [9] at any level in the
  system stack\, i.e.\, IaaS\, Paas\, and SaaS. This would facilitate a wid
 e variety of collaborations\, including areas as diverse as international 
 "big science" collaborations\, international disaster response\, and suppl
 y chain management\, just to name a few. This discussion session will cent
 er around possible federation deployment and governance models that could 
 be built-out in Keystone that embody the key concepts and design principle
 s being developed in the NIST/IEEE Joint WG and ORCA. The success of these
  efforts will depend directly on engaging with cloud builders\, operators\
 , and stakeholders. We welcome the opportunity to pursue this goal with th
 e OpenStack community.\n[1] Press Release: http://standards.ieee.org/news/

DESCRIPTION:For fault management in cloud\, traditional and current teleme
 try/monitoring architectures are good\, but you should enhance the telemet
 ry/monitoring architecture for NFV/Edge/5G/IoT. Because these new services
  have several system architectures\, SLAs that are far from cloud's one\, 
 huge amount of targets you have to monitoring. In Sydney Summit\, there we
 re some great sessions for monitoring/fault management.[1][2][3][4][5][6][
 7] So We can discuss next generation fault management. In this forum\, we 
 are sharing architecture\, use cases\, gap analysis\, OSS for collecting/a
 nalyzing/storing/notifying\, related projects. OPNFV and ONAP has Doctor[8
 ]\, Barometer[9] and DCAE[10] that focus on monitoring and fault managemen
 t. We can also discuss how to adapt these projects to your environments. A
 nd the goal of this forum is sharing of real use cases requiring such faul
 t management and those solutions currently used or to be used in future\, 
 in order to start discussion of good architecture. [1] https://www.opensta

DESCRIPTION:Modern research computing needs at academic institutions are e
 volving. While traditional HPC satisfies most workflows\, researchers seek
  sophisticated\, on-demand\, and self-service control of compute infrastru
 cture. Furthermore\, many also seek policy-compliant safe spaces to comput
 e on sensitive or protected data.\nTo cater to these users\, the Minnesota
  Supercomputing Institute deployed an OpenStack cloud called Stratus. In c
 ontrast to typical clouds\, Stratus does not manage internal infrastructur
 e\; rather\, Stratus complements bare-metal\, fully-managed HPC\, with a s
 elf-service model that can accommodate non-traditional computational and s
 torage needs with HPC-like performance.  \nThis talk describes the lesson
 s learned in launching a platform to support research with specific data-u
 se agreements\; and also issues concerning accountability\, risk acceptanc
 e\, and the role of project leadership when a large supercomputing facilit
 y deviates from its traditional base of support.

DESCRIPTION:For the past 5 years\, CERN IT has employed Ceph technology to
  build scale-out storage for our OpenStack cloud. For the block and object
  storage use-cases\, with and without erasure coding\, Ceph has demonstrat
 ed to be flexible and scalable while being resiliant to infrastructure fai
 lures.\nBut as our computing requirements evolve\, the importance of a sca
 le-out HPC filesystem is emerging. We therefore present usage of CephFS --
  managed by Manila -- in production for our HPC and general IT infrastruct
 ure. We highlight the key metrics required by our users\, including POSIX 
 compliance\, small-file latency\, metadata throughput and scalability\, an
 d fault tolerance\, while showing the results of industry-standard and new
  microbenchmarks.

DESCRIPTION:GPUs in OpenStack? It’s a long-standing question. There are 
 many business cases for providing high-profile GPUs for every instance—n
 amely AI\, mining\, and desktop. Until Queens\, the only solution to expos
 e these devices to the guests was PCI passthrough in Nova—effective\, bu
 t wasteful in terms of resources.\nIn this session\, we’ll show you how\
 , as of Queens\, you can request virtual GPUs (vGPUs) for the libvirt/KVM 
 Nova driver. We'll share how the feature was discussed in the Nova communi
 ty to integrate with the new Placement service\, as well as how very diffe
 rent Nova drivers (Xen and libvirt/KVM) were able to cooperate to implemen
 t a major feature. We'll also discuss current feature limitations\, and sh
 are the roadmap for the next releases.

DESCRIPTION:We've all heard great things about ARM. This new line of proce
 ssors and system architectures brings with it improved performance\, a wid
 er range of vendor offerings\, lower power usage\, and lower prices. This 
 new hardware design could bring OpenStack into new markets such as edge co
 mputing and container infrastructure! However\, is stock OpenStack ready f
 or ARM? Does OpenStack work on ARM as-is? How do the performance number co
 mpare?\nUsing the stock OpenStack source and the installation instructions
  available on OpenStack.org\, we built a Terraform configuration to deploy
  and performance test different hardware systems. This included ARM system
 s from Cavium\, Huawei\, and Qualcomm. As a baseline\, a multi-node Xeon s
 ystem built using the same Terraform configurations was performance tested
 \nWe'll be reviewing the modifications required to the stock\, upstream\, 
 OpenStack code based required for ARM support as well as why other OpenSta

DESCRIPTION:Data volume is growing at an unprecedented rate\, often withou
 t consummate growth in computation needs. The world that lead to the emerg
 ence of the tenets laid out in the GFS and Map Reduce papers has seen a dr
 amatic transformation\, with over a decade of hardware improvements. Disag
 gregation of compute and storage is now commonplace\, championed by organi
 zations like Netflix\, Amazon\, and Airbnb. Pushing storage down a layer a
 nd treating it as an infrastructure service allows data platform teams to 
 focus on increasing the pace of innovation higher up the stack.\nEngineers
  building data platforms on OpenStack clouds expect a varity of storage se
 rvices. Object storage is increasingly becoming the centerpiece of data pl
 atforms\, as it enables in-situ analysis from elastic workload clusters\, 
 low cost\, and massive scalability. The presentation will detail object st
 orage centric data platform architectures\, and how to build rock solid st

 e of the easiest OpenStack distributions to install and configure. In this
  first session you’ll do a (remote) hands-on install of VMware Integrate
 d OpenStack and experience it for yourself. We will also go through the ma
 in differences between VMware Integrated OpenStack and other OpenStack dis
 tributions\, including the benefits as well as the drawbacks.\nKey Take-aw
 ay:\n1.     Attendees will gain an understanding of how to install VMw
 are Integrated OpenStack.\n2.     Attendees will learn about the key b
 enefits of VMware Integrated OpenStack and unique advantages from other Op
 enStack distributions.\n \nSession 2: 3:00 – 4:15\nAdvanced Networking 
 with VMware Integrated OpenStack\nInstructor: Marcos Hernandez & Xiao Gao\
 nVMware NSX is one of the fastest growing segments at VMware and packed wi
 th advanced features. Networking is an important and integral part of Open
 Stack\, but also one of the most complex. Our NSX and OpenStack teams have
  always been working closely together and the result is a solution that gi
 ves you the best of both worlds.\nIn this session you will gain insight in
 to the key features of NSX\, the interaction with Neutron and how it all w
 orks in OpenStack. We will cover key areas including\, firewalls\, load ba
 lancers\, and micro-segmentation\, amongst other items and show how all th
 e pieces fit together.\nKey Take-away:\n1.     Attendees will gain an

DESCRIPTION:We started this OpenStack mission by forming a community of li
 ke minded people who wanted to build open cloud software. Over time\, the 
 community grew to include people who successfully combined OpenStack with 
 many different open source components to automate their infrastructure.\nN
 ow that we’ve become a community of 90\,000 people in 180 countries that
  build and operate infrastructure\, there is a much larger opportunity to 
 bring open infrastructure to new markets. From edge computing\, to AI\, to
  Container Security\, to CI/CD\, the work we do to ensure that the infrast
 ructure our economy relies on is truly open has never been more vital.\nWe
 ’re also lucky to be joined by leaders in open infrastructure\, includin
 g Jim Blair from Zuul to talk CI/CD\, Melvin Hillsman from OpenLab\, Ildik
 o Vansca and Beth Cohen from the edge computing working group\, and Amy Le

DESCRIPTION:If you're new to OpenStack or in want of some mentoring\, this
  session is a great icebreaker and a way to get know new and experienced p
 eople in the OpenStack community. We plan to divide the session between ca
 reer\, technical and community mentoring. Mentees will be organized into s
 mall groups and each group will have several 15 minute mentoring sessions.
  In your small group\, you'll get to know a bit about a mentor and have an
  opportunity to ask them a question or two about how you can grow your car
 eer\, get involved in the community\, and make the most of the summit. The
 n\, at the end of 15 minutes\, a new mentor will cycle to your group and t

 \nGerrit is a free\, web-based team code collaboration tool which integrat
 es closely with Git and allows developers in a team to review each other's
  modifications to the source code using a web browser to approve or reject
  those changes.\nIn this session we will walk participants through opening
  a bug in a test system and then submit a patch to a repository in OpenSta
 c k. The process involves learning about Git using the most common command
 s and progressing through the review process in Gerrit. Participants will 
 walk away with a working knowledge of these tools.

DESCRIPTION:Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV) facilitates the development and 
 evolution of NFV components across various open source ecosystems. OpenDay
 light (ODL) is a modular open platform for customizing and automating netw
 orks of any size and scale. OPNFV and ODL communities have been working t
 ogether in order to establish seamless flow of software across the communi
 ties by following and applying CI/CD and DevOps principles and best practi
 ces. One crucial piece of this is ODL Continuous Delivery Pipelines which
  make the latest & greatest versions of the software available frequently 
 to OPNFV and anyone else interested in them in different forms such as pac
 kages\, containers and so on. OPNFV XCI heavily utilizes ODL CD Pipelines
  to create integrated solutions for next generation telecom networks. Thi
 s helps other communities and users of ODL to develop new features\, fix b
 ugs\, create integrated solutions\, and innovate much faster than before.
  \nDuring this keynote\, we will talk about the challenges our communitie
 s faced during the early phases and how these communities overcome them by
  applying CI/CD and DevOps principles and practices.

DESCRIPTION:Various initiatives have been going on across open source comm

 pecially when there is a need to bring different open source components to
 gether to see how well they work in system context.\nHowever\, working on 
 the problems that are common and span across different communities in an i
 solated manner is not beneficial for the ecosystem since what is done by e
 ach of these communities can potentially be shared by others who are worki
 ng on solving similar problems. This includes but not limited to improved 
 way of working\, alignment on CI/CD\, reuse of the tooling.\nRecently\, de
 velopers from open source communities came together and started working on
  things in a collaborative manner. The thinking behind this was that once 
 we get to know each other and start talking\, the rest would be much easie
 r and quicker. The topics of interest are infrastructure\, CI/CD\, integra
 tion & testing so we could look for the answers together.

DESCRIPTION:The OpenStack Infra team runs one of the world’s largest Ope
 n Source CI/CD systems in service of OpenStack’s early decision to mand
 ate that all merges only be performed by automation if and only if all te
 sts pass. Accomplishing this at scale involves a combination of software
  and policy.Zuul is the software engine developed to handle this.Zuul is 
 not OpenStack specific. With the rise of microservices and kubernetes\, t
 he number of multi-repo projects is increasing\, as is the need for CI sy
 stems that understand them. The most recent version ofZuul has been rework
 ed to make it easy for other people\, communities or organizations to har
 ness its power regardless of any relationship with OpenStack.We’ll talk
  about the things that make Zuul special - multi-repository dependencies\
 , optimistic branch prediction and deep Ansible integration. And we’ll 
 walk through how to get started with a private or a public Zuul.

  requires the automatic management of software components on live systems 
 and the possibility to send feedback from the live systems to the develope
 rs. ETSI NFV defined a multi layer MANO framework to manage the different 
 layers of telecom services. OpenStack\, as the defacto standard VIM\, is a
  key enabler of DevOps in the NFV architecture\, because of its capability
  to dynamically manage workloads. Currently there is an activity within t
 he NFV community to introduce capabilities that allow DevOps and CI/CD co

DESCRIPTION:We will share our story of CI/CD transformation of 1000s of le
 gacy monolith applications on OpenStack using Blue/Green and Canary contin
 uous delivery strategies. Continuous delivery is becoming increasingly cri
 tical but it still remains a hard problem many enterprises struggle with. 
 We will present lessons learned in the process of achieving new levels of 
 automation on OpenStack. \nCanary upgrades and Blue/Green deployment are t
 he two commonly used patterns to implement continuous delivery. In Canary 
 upgrades\, a small portion of the production traffic is sent to the new ve
 rsion under test. In blue/green deployments\, all the traffic is switched 
 to the new version and programmatically switched back in case the evaluati
 on fails.\nWe will show how to fully automate above steps to achieve true 
 continuous delivery in OpenStack using Ansible and LBaaS. We will show how
  to use analytics to express and automate application evaluation and ML ba
 sed traffic switching without any downtime.

  as both RPMs and PyPi packages. We then built CI/CD pipelines using Screw
 driver and Chef which pull down the custom packages that are published by 
 our build system and deploy them individually in minutes. The pipelines ar

 and as a result enginteers lack visibility into the workings of the OpenSt
 ack environment. In this track you will learn about an OpenStack native mo
 nitoring tool called Monasca (Monitoring As A Service At Scale) that provi
 des visibility into OpenStack environments. Monasca provides visibility of
  compute\, block storage\, image service\, authentication\, networking\, a
 nd more. In this presentation we plan to cover:- A tour of OP5's implement
 ation of Monasca- How to deploy Monasca on bare metal and within OpenStack
 - Best practices for OpenStack monitoringAbout OP5OP5 has developed an ent
 erprise level monitoring solution with full support for OpenStack. It is b
 ased upon the OpenStack project Monasca\, meaning a high performing scalab
 le fault tolerant solution from start.Monasca is based on microservice arc
 hitecture which enables high scalability\, both horizontally and verticall
 y\, and as a result OP5's monitoring solution is able to process millions 
 of metrics per second.OP5's monitoring solution for OpenStack can also han
 dle constant data streams being both pulled and pushed from within the env
 ironment. The architecture is built on a highly-performant message bus cap
 able of ingesting a constant flow of data streams as opposed to a master-s
 lave polling for events.Our solution supports agent authentication through
  Keystone\, a OpenStack authentication project. The use of tenants make it
  possible to separate authentication and authorization on a per-project-ba
 sis\, and It makes it possible to separate departments or customers sharin
 g the same platform\, giving a reliable\, multi-tenant solution.In the sam
 e vein as OP5's other monitoring solutions\, this is based upon robust API
 s enabling integrations with other applications for analytics and visualiz

  new regions\, in order to achieve better scalability\, we had established
  a CLOS type network underlay all the way from top level fabric routers to
  the hypervisor itself\, while keeping our cloud architecture fairly simpl

DESCRIPTION:Ceph has historically been challenged by transactional workloa
 ds requiring Iow latencies in the sub 10ms range.  This has excluded Ceph
  RBD from a whole class of applications and limited its adoption in the en
 terprise.   New technologies like RDMA\, NVMe and 3D XPoint have emerged
  in the last few years that are having a significant impact on Ceph by ena
 bling deterministic\, low latency (sub 10ms) performance.  In this talk w
 e explore these technologies\, demonstrating how they can be used in a Ce
 ph Luminous Cluster to deliver groundbreaking performance\, opening whole 
 new classes of workloads to the Ceph ecosystem.

DESCRIPTION:Multiple clouds are a must in today&rsquo\;s IT world to preve
 nt vendor lock-in\, provide redundancy\, a migration path\, and other bene
 fits.   Developer's and IT admins demand that applications\, and the micro
 -services that comprise them\, be capable of running in multiple environme
 nts.   A service mesh\, instantiated by Istio\, provides a new paradigm fo
 r connecting\, managing and securing microservices.   With services runnin
 g in multiple clouds\, service mesh has to be established across the cloud
 s.   In this presentation John and Tim will show how an application can be
  stretched between two disparate cloud environments--public cloud and an O
 penStack based cloud.   The demonstration will show how the service mesh i
 s stretched to fully enable service mesh features for all services and end
 points in both cloud environments.

DESCRIPTION:Federated keystone identity provides a mechanism for end users
  to use existing credentials maintained by an organization's own identity 
 provider. FreeIPA is an Identity and Authentication management solution. I
 n this presentation\, we describe integrating keystone with FreeIPA as the
  backend identity provider using OpenID Connect as the federation protocol
 . This setup eases the burden of user account administration within OpenSt
 ack providing users access to the Horizon dashboard and OpenStackClient to
 ols using existing FreeIPA credentials. We describe the development of a s
 elf service web portal for users to manage an API key\, a new authenticati
 on plugin for keystone\, and integrating an OAuth2/OpenID consent endpoint
  for FreeIPA. Access control is provided by a custom ACL extension in the 
 federated keystone driver pulling groups and projects directly from FreeIP
 A. This work is supported by Aristotle\, a NSF DIBBs funded federated clou
 d consortium and SUNY at Buffalo's LakeEffect cloud.

DESCRIPTION:Upgrading directly from Juno to Ocata is something the OpenSta

 it with almost zero impact on our customers. A key piece of this task was 
 running five database migrations across three components (Nova\, Glance\,

 migration was the re-imaging of almost 1\,000 HVs to upgrade the OS and Li
 bvirt\, and also migrating our custom patches and plugins to work with the
  Ocata code base. During this entire process\, any given VM was only down 
 for a few hours during the HV upgrade\, while the Nova API had even less d
 owntime. We are currently expanding on this work for the Juno to Ocata upg
 rade of Ironic and Neutron in our Bare Metal clusters and will publish det

DESCRIPTION:Upgrading directly from Juno to Ocata is something the OpenSta
 ck community never intended for anyone to do\, however we at Oath managed 
 it with almost zero impact on our customers. A key piece of this task was 
 running five database migrations across three components (Nova\, Glance\, 
 and Keystone)\, which took about an hour. Related work leading up to this 
 migration was the re-imaging of almost 1\,000 HVs to upgrade the OS and Li
 bvirt\, and also migrating our custom patches and plugins to work with the
  Ocata code base. During this entire process\, any given VM was only down 
 for a few hours during the HV upgrade\, while the Nova API had even less d
 owntime. We are currently expanding on this work for the Juno to Ocata upg
 rade of Ironic and Neutron in our Bare Metal clusters and will publish det
 ails on this at a later date.

 rator’s mind. With the use of Ansible\, an agentless IT automation techn
 ology\, a system administrator can do just that.\nThe goal of this lab is 
 to provide a brief introduction to Ansible\, the usability of Ansible play
 books\, and then show how to leverage key Ansible modules to better manage
  and simplify OpenStack environments. These management playbooks will cons
 ist of typical administrative tasks such as:\nManaging Networks\nManaging 
 Instances\nManaging Resources\nThis lab is best suited for system and Open
 Stack administrators looking for ways to automate their day-to-day OpenSta
 ck administrative tasks\nLab Requirements:\n- A laptop with an SSH client

DESCRIPTION:Using OpenStack for a public cloud has a range of challenges\,
  and one of hardest parts is often billing. This is an area deployers may 
 run into some frustrating and unexpected problems.\nDeployers expect a goo
 d billing system to inergrate with their existing ERP system\, but those i
 ntegrations likely need custom features and flexibility.\nThey need to be 
 ready to handle bugs in the telemetry chain (service bugs\, notification b
 ugs\, ceilometer bugs)\, and make sure their billing isn't missing informa
 tion because of it.\nTheir solution needs to be able to handle at least 10
 00+ customers and 50+ metrics/products.\nIn this session\, we will share t
 he first-hand experience about running billing on Catalyst Cloud\, which i
 s a public cloud based in New Zealand.

DESCRIPTION:Security Monkey is an open source security project from Netfli
 x that monitors cloud accounts for policy changes and alerts to insecure o
 r noncompliant configurations. Originally developed for AWS in 2014\, Goog
 le later added support for GCP. We will present our work to integrate Open
 Stack. Available in the 1.0 release\, initial support targets the major co
 mponents of Neutron\, Nova\, and Swift.\nWith Security Monkey\, OpenStack 
 project configurations are continuously audited against defined rules with
  alerts generated for violations (a security group that allows unrestricte
 d SSH to an Internet-facing VM or public Swift containers). By keeping an 
 inventory and history of all deltas\, owners have visibility into when ite
 ms are created\, modified\, or removed. Security Monkey can be easily exte
 nded/customized and provides a dashboard to view open issues and the overa
 ll security posture of monitored OpenStack projects. We will perform a liv

DESCRIPTION:In the past 2017\, China Mobile has published its distributed 
 shared file system service in the public cloud. It's based on manila with 
 GlusterFs backend and use NFS-Ganesha to export the NFS protocol\, it can 
 provide service for both virtual machine users and bare metal users at the
  same time.We'd like to share how we build it\, including the driver integ
 ration and optimization\, the network solutions and the way to solve the S
 PF issues.\nFocus on the following aspects:1. GlusterFS and NFS-Ganesha in
 tegration\, why and how.2. What did we do to make NFS-Ganesha driver effic
 ienly and reliability.3. Network solution to make virtual machines and bar

DESCRIPTION:Two critical DNS gaps occur within traditional NFV and contain
 ers deployments - lack of IP address automation and DNS-based security ris
 ks. In this demo\, Infoblox will highlight how Carrier-grade DNS and IP ad
 dress management (IPAM) closes these gaps. Infoblox helps speed deployment
 s and improve visibility by automating provisioning and discovery of dynam
 ic virtual and container resources by integrating in your orchestration an
 d ONAP processes. Even though security is top of mind for every telco and 
 organization across the world\, security holes for DNS are still a major c
 oncern. Over 95% of tested organizations allowed data exfiltration via DNS
  tunnels because existing tools allow open DNS communications. In this dem
 o\, Infoblox will highlight how data can easily be stolen via DNS\, and mo
 re importantly\, how to stop this risk.

DESCRIPTION:The next wave of transformation for Telco Cloud is Hyper-conve
 rged NFV infrastructure (NFVi) which is expected to bring cost efficiency 
 and scale.  Storage is a key piece of any Hyper-converged platform and ne
 w solid-state storage technologies such as Intel Optane\, are bringing a b
 ig shift in compute vs storage budget balance in Hyper-converged platforms
 .  Intel and its Telco partners are collaborating on developing new ways 
 to leverage these technologies in Ceph to enable a low latency\, high perf
 ormance OpenStack platform for Telco NFV applications.  Join the team to 
 hear about our contributions to Ceph and Openstack-HELM and take away the 
 basics of tuning Hyper-converged Ceph.

DESCRIPTION:Telco NFV-Infrastructure transformation is about moving away f
 rom closed\, monolithic\, appliance-built network to a more open\, flexibl
 e infrastructure. An open\, agile\, and cloud native model will enable Com
 munication Service Providers (CSPs) to innovate\, deploy\, and manage new 
 services. HPE\, in partnership with Red Hat\, offers a new way for CSPs to
  design\, deploy\, and manage networking services from the Core out to the
  Edge. The new HPE NFV Blueprints are validated reference designs that com
 e with toolset that leverages open industry standards like Redfish to auto
 mate deployment and configuration of the NFVI stack. They help reduce comp
 lexity\, lower risk\, and enable faster time to value for CSPs to deploy t
 heir Telco NFV- Infrastructure. By decoupling the network functions from p
 roprietary hardware appliances and embracing virtualization and open indus
 try solutions\, CSPs can accelerate new\, compelling services in an effici
 ent\, cost‐effective model.

UID:21300@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:One of the most exciting concepts in the 5G paradigm is the id
 ea of Network Slicing (NS). While NS has not been ratified as a standard a
 s of yet\, current drafts suggest NS requires the end to end network virtu
 alization and the ability to manage Quality of Service (QoS). Further\, as
  specified by various standards bodies\, NS effectively requires APIs exis
 t to manage it.\nMany of the major requirements of 5G NS are already satis
 fied by OpenStack networking\, such as QoS\, isolation\, segregation\, sha
 ring networks\, and of course\, automation/orchestration via Neutron APIs.
 \nIn this presentation we will review what NS is based on draft documents 
 by standards bodies\, as well as what requirements of NS are satisfied by 
 OpenStack. We will explore how OpenStack can be integrated in a SP network
  in order to enable NS. We will also demonstrate a simulated SP network an
 d what level of NS can currently be accomplished by OpenStack and Manageme

DESCRIPTION:   One of the challenges for NFV is to achieve the performance
  as high as dedicated hardware. SR-IOV is used for such a purpose. However
 \, you lose the flexibility of virtualization because it highly depends on
  hardware.\n   DPDK is emerging solution for NFV\, but there are still dif
 ficulties to use it in OpenStack. This is because DPDK should be aware of 
 physical computing resources\, such as NIC ports\, CPU cores\, and NUMA no
 des.\n   In this talk\, we show how much the performance changes if those 
 physical resources are well tuned for optimization. We explain how to work
  around tuning difficulties in OpenStack giving an illustration of the usa
 ge of networking-spp. Networking-spp is a Neutron ML2 plugin for SPP (Soft
  Patch Panel). SPP is implemented on DPDK. It behaves like a patch panel a
 nd enables VNFs to communicate each other.\n   We also mention the remaini
 ng tasks for optimization and how they are going to be solved in the Place
 ment\, a resource management service from the Nova project.

DESCRIPTION:Placement in OpenStack carries two fundamental issues that lim
 it its scalability. First\, Nova scheduler is too slow for large clouds\, 
 as it requires full knowledge of the system's state for its decisions. Sec
 ond\, the orchestration engine (Heat) enables launching multi-VM cloud app
 lications\, but deploys them one at a time since Nova lacks the required a
 pplication level awareness. This may lead to under-utilization and sub-opt
 imal performance.\nThis session addresses both issues. We will show a fast
 er alternative to Nova scheduler and an enhancement for application level 
 deployment. Through extensive evaluation on real datasets\, we will show t
 hat the new scheduler achieves up to x5.3 faster placements with similar q
 uality.  We will also show that our enhancement improves the performance 
 and acceptance ratio of network services.

DESCRIPTION:NFV deployment is a multi-layered stack where a unified Orches
 trator such as ONAP takes the responsibility of closed-loop automation for
  the resilience of virtual network function (VNF). The closed-loop should 
 be event driven for both efficiency and accuracy. The closed-loop is trigg
 ered by some symptom usually coming from given alert or event.  Once trig
 gered\, a predefined policy is used to connect the symptom with proper rec
 over operations which is a status machine relying on events too. So\, the 
 design of event driven framework becomes the key of closed loop. VNFs are 
 often deployed and running on OpenStack for its rich resource management f
 unctions and API. To transfer the events from OpenStack to ONAP\, we need 
 to weave together various message bus systems and event sources. In this p
 resentation\, we will share an innovated framework which federates the eve
 nts/alerts/metrics across different layers and sources with a demo of clos
 ed-loop automation through typical NFV use cases.

 The proposed solution enables dynamic policy reconfiguration instead of st
 atic OSLO policy.json and enables external PDP to manage multiple OpenStac
 k deployments for NFV NGPoPs. The organization of this PDP contains a set 
 of upstreamed hooks to OpenStack/OSLO\, OpenDaylight/AAA\, and possibly Tu

DESCRIPTION:As the Verizon Wireless OpenStack Edge platform grows\, making
  efficient use of resources also grows in importance\, to deliver the cost
  benefits of OpenStack to Verizon customers. This presentation explores ho
 w utilization at the highest level\, Virtual Network Function (VNF) redund
 ancy pairs\, relates to utilizations at intermediate and lower levels. For
  example\, an intermediate level\, a nova server\, corresponds to a lower 
 level Libvirt instance\, which in turn is composed of CPU cores which each
  have utilizations. In some cases\, these CPU cores may be pinned by the V
 NF design\, and used at 100%\, in which case no optimization is possible. 
 In other cases\, some over-subscription may be possible without impacting 
 services. In addition to tying a given nova VM together with its foundatio
 nal levels\, each VNF frequently contains multiple nova instances\, neutro
 n networks\, and cinder volumes\, which also must be considered when over-
 subscribing.

DESCRIPTION:We have previously shown how OPNFV Barometer (Platform Service
  Assurance) can facilitate the adoption of NFV by providing the critical p
 latform and NFVI metrics required to detect and correct faults before serv
 ice outages occur.\nOutside of SA\, Barometer has proven quite useful by p
 roviding standardized metric sets for different applications fulfilling a 
 variety of purposes e.g.\, benchmarking\, Intelligent orchestration\, SUT 
 characterization/analysis\, etc\nThe OPNFV Bottlenecks project simulates e
 xtreme or long term product usage to verify if the SUT could survive to m
 eet some quality requirements which are based on the monitoring metrics.\n
 The OPNFV Yardstick project has made use of these same metrics in network 
 services benchmarking and for VNF characterization.\nThis talk will show h
 ow Barometer can be used in conjunction with Bottlenecks and Yardstick to 
 fulfill use cases beyond service assurance to further ease the transition 
 to NFV by promoting standardization and interoperability.

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180524T184000Z
UID:21536@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Beyond OpenStack for IT\, NFV is another killer use case. Hori
 zontally\, multiple NGPoPs (OpenStack deployments) are geographically dist
 ributed but should be centrally controlled. Vertically\, users of cross-la
 yer services like bare-metal\, IaaS\, VNF and/or SDN should be federated. 
 Hence\, Identity and Access Management (IAM) module becomes a key issue.\n
 The proposed solution enables dynamic policy reconfiguration instead of st
 atic OSLO policy.json and enables external PDP to manage multiple OpenStac
 k deployments for NFV NGPoPs. The organization of this PDP contains a set 
 of upstreamed hooks to OpenStack/OSLO\, OpenDaylight/AAA\, and possibly Tu
 ngsten Fabric in the future. It also proposed a reference implementation o
 f the security engine policy called Moon hosted by the OPNFV community.\nO
 range as major Telco operator is planning the deployment in production of 
 this “external PDP mechanism” in 2019 for its first VNFs\, in collabor
 ation with the upstream community and Red Hat.
