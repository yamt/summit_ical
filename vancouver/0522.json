L3 flavors enables the cloud to serve multiple backends in a single deployment. This serves many use cases where users want to have special mapping for underlay and overlay networks and they can have router of multiple choices. Each backend that serves virtual routing and forwarding needs to implement a L3 flavor drivers using neutron L3 flavor framework.

The NIST\/IEEE Joint WG on Federated Cloud [1,2,3] has been running for almost seven months now, and recently held their first workshop [4] to report-out on current work and invite stakeholders to review, comment, help in charting the course of future work. The Open Research Cloud Alliance [5] has been actively developing consensus across the scientific community stakeholders and will be holding their 4th Open Research Cloud Congress at the Vancouver Summit. The Open Geospatial Consortium will also be kicking-off their Testbed-14 [6] project in April which has a federated cloud task to demonstrate specific geospatial data sharing scenarios.<br \/><br \/> This Forum topic will continue the discussion around cloud federation started at the OpenStack Summit Forum in Sydney [7,8]. Keystone, OpenStack and the OpenStack community are in a unique position to take a leadership position and make significant contributions to this process. Keystone has already built-out basic support to \"federate-in\" identities and \"federate-out\" OpenStack services. With modest additional capabilities Keystone could support general federations across multiple administrative domains [9] at any level in the system stack, i.e., IaaS, Paas, and SaaS. This would facilitate a wide variety of collaborations, including areas as diverse as international \"big science\" collaborations, international disaster response, and supply chain management, just to name a few.<br \/><br \/> This discussion session will center around possible federation deployment and governance models that could be built-out in Keystone that embody the key concepts and design principles being developed in the NIST\/IEEE Joint WG and ORCA. The success of these efforts will depend directly on engaging with cloud builders, operators, and stakeholders. We welcome the opportunity to pursue this goal with the OpenStack community.<\/p>\n<p>[1] Press Release: <a href=\"http:\/\/standards.ieee.org\/news\/2017\/intercloud_interoperability_and_federation.html\">http:\/\/standards.ieee.org\/news\/2017\/intercloud_interoperability_and_federation.html<\/a><br \/>[2] NIST Public WG on Federated Cloud:<br \/>Twiki Page: <a href=\"http:\/\/collaborate.nist.gov\/twiki-cloud-computing\/bin\/view\/CloudComputing\/FederatedCloudPWGFC\">http:\/\/collaborate.nist.gov\/twiki-cloud-computing\/bin\/view\/CloudComputing\/FederatedCloudPWGFC<\/a><br \/>Mailing List: fedcloud@nist.gov<br \/>[3] IEEE\/P2302 Intercloud WG:<br \/> Project Site: <a href=\"http:\/\/sites.ieee.org\/sagroups-2302\/\">http:\/\/sites.ieee.org\/sagroups-2302\/<\/a><br \/> Mailing List: STDS-P2302@ieee.org<br \/> [4] NIST\/IEEE Federation Cloud Workshop, <a href=\"http:\/\/federatedcloud.eventbrite.com\">http:\/\/federatedcloud.eventbrite.com <\/a><br \/> [5] <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openresearchcloud.org\">http:\/\/www.openresearchcloud.org<\/a><br \/> [6] OGC Testbed-14, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opengeospatial.org\/projects\/initiatives\/testbed14\">http:\/\/www.opengeospatial.org\/projects\/initiatives\/testbed14 <\/a><br \/> [7] <a href=\"https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/Supporting-General-Federation\">https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/Supporting-General-Federation <\/a><br \/> [8] <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/sydney-2017\/summit-schedule\/events\/20534\/3rd-open-research-cloudcongress\">https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/sydney-2017\/summit-schedule\/events\/20534\/3rd-open-research-cloudcongress<\/a><br \/> [9] Lee, C.

From the pay gap, online harassment and female entrepreneurship to access to the best jobs, the decision to leave or stay in tech and the role of male allies, the series will illustrate how we pave the way forward.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chasinggracefilm.com\/\">https:\/\/www.chasinggracefilm.com\/<\/a><\/p>","start_epoch":1527005400,"end_epoch":1527007200,"start_datetime":"2018-05-22 16:10:00","end_datetime":"2018-05-22 16:40:00","start_time":"4:10pm","end_time":"4:40pm","date_nice":"Tue 22","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":367,"type_id":158,"rsvp_link":"","has_rsvp":false,"rsvp_external":true,"rsvp_seat_type":"N\/A","sponsors_id":[],"category_group_ids":[83],"tags_id":[2034],"going":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"summit_id":24,"time_zone_id":"America\/Vancouver","attendees_schedule_count":18,"track_id":217,"attachment_url":"","to_record":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/vancouver-2018\/summit-schedule\/events\/21782\/chasing-grace-screening","social_summary":"Chasing Grace Screening ","speakers_id":[14584],"moderator_id":0,"level":"N\/A","status":"unaccepted"},{"id":21883,"title":"Kata Containers 1.0 Release Thank You","class_name":"SummitEvent","abstract":"<p>Join us in the afternoon break to celebrate the Kata Containers 1.0 release and contributors who have made this first release happen.<\/p>\n<p>Refreshments and Kata swag provided!<\/p>","start_epoch":1527005400,"end_epoch":1527007200,"start_datetime":"2018-05-22 16:10:00","end_datetime":"2018-05-22 16:40:00","start_time":"4:10pm","end_time":"4:40pm","date_nice":"Tue 22","allow_feedback":"0","location_id":370,"type_id":164,"rsvp_link":"","has_rsvp":false,"rsvp_external":true,"rsvp_seat_type":"N\/A","sponsors_id":[],"category_group_ids":[],"tags_id":[],"going":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"summit_id":24,"time_zone_id":"America\/Vancouver","attendees_schedule_count":38,"track_id":212,"attachment_url":"","to_record":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/vancouver-2018\/summit-schedule\/events\/21883\/kata-containers-1-0-release-thank-you","social_summary":"Kata Containers 1.0.0 Release Thank You"},{"id":21812,"title":"Supercharging Your Multicloud Strategy","class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p>Supercharging Your Multicloud Strategy<br \/><br \/>Enterprises are leveraging the power of cloud to build applications that can scale in real-time to serve their users.

So, the design of event driven framework becomes the key of closed loop. VNFs are often deployed and running on OpenStack for its rich resource management functions and API. To transfer the events from OpenStack to ONAP, we need to weave together various message bus systems and event sources.
