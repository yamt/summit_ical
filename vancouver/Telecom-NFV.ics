DESCRIPTION:OPNFV provides different ways to install OpenStack\, but also 
 provides multiple testing tools for OpenStack and\, soon\, even Kubernetes
 . Vendors who integrate OpenStack for service providers also need to know 
 how to validate that OpenStack is a fit for NFV requirements.  This sessio
 n is to be presented by two OPNFV Functest contributors who will detail ho
 w some components developed in OPNFV have been used to test/validate comme
 rcial solutions in addition to the internal QA test. \nThe best practices 
 learned in OPNFV were used to design and build a CI chain including jenkin
 s\, functest\, yardstick\, the test API and the Test DB.

 OpenStack on NUMA-based architectures\, where one poor scheduling decision
  can result in drastic performance reductions. Thankfully\, OpenStack real
 ized this some time ago and has been doing many wonderful things since the
 n to prevent this pain. In this talk\, we shine a light on all things NUMA
 \, from both a general and OpenStack-orientated perspective.Coming out of 
 this talk\, you should know everything there is to know about NUMA in Open
 Stack and will be able to\, one can hope\, finally put those performance i
 ssues to bed and get some sleep.

DESCRIPTION:In this talk we will introduce the pre-integrated system defin
 ition and practice demo.China Mobile currently apply a distributed telecom
  cloud architecture. There are numerous edge telecom cloud nodes to be bui
 lt/operation/maintenance. The edge nodes are all based on OpenStack's thre
 e-layer decoupling architecture. We build the pre-integrated model to solv
 e the problem\, involving OPNFV integrated tools and ONAP remote operation
  management. That means firstly we build several pre-integrated edge TIC t
 emplate\, which is standardized/modular/scalable\, then batch production o
 f numbers of edge TICs\, deliver to many edge locations\, plug and play\, 
 remote operation/maintenance\, simplify local workload. In the demo\, we w
 ill show pre-integrated delivery verification in China Mobile NovoNet proj
 ect\, including the definition of pre-integrated templates (hardware and s
 oftware planning and design)\, template instantiation (system deployment\,
  integration testing\, etc.) and integrated delivery on-line.

SUMMARY:5G Network Slicing and OpenStack
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T221000Z
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T225000Z
UID:21300@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:One of the most exciting concepts in the 5G paradigm is the id
 ea of Network Slicing (NS). While NS has not been ratified as a standard a
 s of yet\, current drafts suggest NS requires the end to end network virtu
 alization and the ability to manage Quality of Service (QoS). Further\, as
  specified by various standards bodies\, NS effectively requires APIs exis
 t to manage it.\nMany of the major requirements of 5G NS are already satis
 fied by OpenStack networking\, such as QoS\, isolation\, segregation\, sha
 ring networks\, and of course\, automation/orchestration via Neutron APIs.
 \nIn this presentation we will review what NS is based on draft documents 
 by standards bodies\, as well as what requirements of NS are satisfied by 
 OpenStack. We will explore how OpenStack can be integrated in a SP network
  in order to enable NS. We will also demonstrate a simulated SP network an
 d what level of NS can currently be accomplished by OpenStack and Manageme
 nt and Orchestration (MANO) systems such as Open Baton.

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180522T000000Z
UID:20826@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:   One of the challenges for NFV is to achieve the performance
  as high as dedicated hardware. SR-IOV is used for such a purpose. However
 \, you lose the flexibility of virtualization because it highly depends on
  hardware.\n   DPDK is emerging solution for NFV\, but there are still dif
 ficulties to use it in OpenStack. This is because DPDK should be aware of 
 physical computing resources\, such as NIC ports\, CPU cores\, and NUMA no
 des.\n   In this talk\, we show how much the performance changes if those 
 physical resources are well tuned for optimization. We explain how to work
  around tuning difficulties in OpenStack giving an illustration of the usa
 ge of networking-spp. Networking-spp is a Neutron ML2 plugin for SPP (Soft
  Patch Panel). SPP is implemented on DPDK. It behaves like a patch panel a
 nd enables VNFs to communicate each other.\n   We also mention the remaini
 ng tasks for optimization and how they are going to be solved in the Place
 ment\, a resource management service from the Nova project.

UID:20702@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Network services today consist of multiple virtual network fun
 ctions (VNFs) which are usually deployed across multiple domains. To conne
 ct different domains\, the NFV orchestrator often has to interface with va
 rious legacy systems and physical network functions to establish well desi
 gned underlay (e.g. Layer3 VPN based on WAN or SPTN) and overlay (e.g. EV
 PN based VXLAN). In each domain OpenStack is usually used to build an op
 en infrastructure. While\, the third-party SDN products from legacy networ
 k system vendors are also leveraged to manage virtual networks. It becomes
  problems how to coordinate the local virtual networks and legacy SDN pro
 ducts and how to achieve the VPN connectivity across different domains. I
 n this presentation\, we will introduce a Neutron ML2 hierarchical port bi
 nding based solution by a typical NFV use case built in ONAP Amsterdam Rel
 ease and analyze the network packets travel path through different network

 ure to implement management and classification of VM traffic. One possible
  solution is to trigger the traffic path chaining via installing tacker VN
 FFG or upgrading the installed tacker VNFFG in an external monitoring tool

DESCRIPTION:Telecom industry is in the evolution with IOT\, 5G and MicroEd
 ge design. Network for millions of subscribers and IOT devices must be rel
 iable\, scalable\, secure\, affordable and provide low latency with high t
 hroughput. To achieve that goals telecom industry is trying to find most e
 fficient application&rsquo\;s architecture to meet highly demanding goals 
 and fully utilize available resources. At this moment there are 3 main way
 s to design telco applications: micro services architecture with container
 s\, Virtual Machines and Bare Metal.  \nI would share recommendations on d
 esigning telco applications with all 3 methods based on results of AT&T in
 ternal POCs and research work. AT&T labs has spent significant amount of t
 ime working with vendors and performing different types of testing includi
 ng security and performance testing. Taking into consideration that result
 s we can provide very clear recommendation for selecting VM&rsquo\;s vs Co
 ntainers vs Bare metal for telecom applications.

DESCRIPTION:Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides the ability to define
  an ordered list of network services (e.g.\, firewalls or load balancers)\
 , and then these services are stitched together to create a service chain.
  In Tacker\, OpenStack and Kubernetes can be used as VIMs for Virtual Mach
 ine and Container based VNFs respectively\, and TOSCA-based VNFFG can defi
 ne the service chain in a VM-based VIM like OpenStack or in a container-ba
 sed VIM like Kubernetes. This session talks about the challenges of implem
 enting the SFC support for mixed type VNFs (VM and container) to create th
 e service chain. It also covers the basic software architecture and talks 
 about the new feature with a demonstration.

 s to expand their limits and perform automatic actions such auto-healing o
 r auto-scaling. In a live demo we'll show how the generic VNFM uses its au
 to operations capability to sample the VNFs health\, and report its state 
 to Vitrage.  Vitrage is responsible for correlating the HW failures with t
 he VNF resource health\, and through a process of deduced alarms\, notifyi

DESCRIPTION:We have previously shown how OPNFV Barometer (Platform Service
  Assurance) can facilitate the adoption of NFV by providing the critical p
 latform and NFVI metrics required to detect and correct faults before serv
 ice outages occur.\nOutside of SA\, Barometer has proven quite useful by p
 roviding standardized metric sets for different applications fulfilling a 
 variety of purposes e.g.\, benchmarking\, Intelligent orchestration\, SUT 
 characterization/analysis\, etc\nThe OPNFV Bottlenecks project simulates e
 xtreme or long term product usage to verify if the SUT could survive to me
 et some quality requirements which are based on the monitoring metrics.\nT
 he OPNFV Yardstick project has made use of these same metrics in network s

  (core\, aggregation or edge) we proposed to use both OpenStack and Kubern
 etes at VIM level\, with Kuryr as the glue enabling both deployment models
 . As we integrate several network layers and orchestrators we have had to 
 integrate several network layers: Neutron\, Kubernetes\, Kuryr and orchest
 rators (ManageIQ\, OSM\, Tacker...). This session will go along and explai
 n all the interactions between them and how Kuryr can be used as a common 
 element.

DESCRIPTION:NFV deployment is a multi-layered stack where a unified Orches
 trator such as ONAP takes the responsibility of closed-loop automation for
  the resilience of virtual network function (VNF). The closed-loop should 
 be event driven for both efficiency and accuracy. The closed-loop is trigg
 ered by some symptom usually coming from given alert or event.  Once trig
 gered\, a predefined policy is used to connect the symptom with proper rec
 over operations which is a status machine relying on events too. So\, the 
 design of event driven framework becomes the key of closed loop. VNFs are 
 often deployed and running on OpenStack for its rich resource management f
 unctions and API. To transfer the events from OpenStack to ONAP\, we need 
 to weave together various message bus systems and event sources. In this p
 resentation\, we will share an innovated framework which federates the eve
 nts/alerts/metrics across different layers and sources with a demo of clos
 ed-loop automation through typical NFV use cases.

DESCRIPTION:Swisscom TV MediaCloud is currently operating a large OpenStac
 k-based cloud for supporting NFV applications and is expanding further as 
 we on-board more applications. Our deployment runs on COTS servers and is
  fully capable for service level orchestration. Swisscom currently impleme
 nts virtualized/containerized TV media functions such as transcoding\, str
 eaming\, and hosting backend applications. Using respective API functions 
 of TV MediaCloud\, Swisscom is able to deploy services within minutes inst
 ead of weeks.\nIn this talk\, we will share the challenges and the lessons
  learned in designing and building this OpenStack-based NFV Cloud. We will
  focus on both business and technical aspects of the NFV applications we o
 n-boarded and how that translated into the highly challenging requirements
  from the underlying cloud. For example\, to ensure hugh availability of e
 very component and no single point of failure\, we needed to support ZERO 
 packet loss multicast traffic and very low jitter.\n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:As more and more workloads move off dedicated hardware into th
 e cloud as virtual appliances\, it is critical to ensure predictable perfo
 rmance and guarantee the quality of service. Contention for hardware resou
 rce such as cache\, memory and network bandwidth affects performance in th
 e same vein as resources such as CPU and RAM，especially for latency and 
 jitter sensitive Network Virtual Functions (NFV) workload. We introduce Re
 source Management Daemon (RMD)\, a system daemon running on generic Linux 
 platforms\, to provide cache allocation capability to the resource control
  arsenal.\nIn this talk we discuss the Resource Management Daemon (RMD) ar
 chitecture\, components\, and the design of monitor component that will tr
 ack and fine tune allocations to meet service level agreements. We then sh
 ow how RMD significantly benefits the NFV use case. Last but not least we 
 share how RMD can be leveraged by cloud and container orchestration engine
 s to effectively introduce cache allocation capabilities.

DESCRIPTION:Beyond OpenStack for IT\, NFV is another killer use case. Hori

 Hence\, Identity and Access Management (IAM) module becomes a key issue.\n
 The proposed solution enables dynamic policy reconfiguration instead of st
 atic OSLO policy.json and enables external PDP to manage multiple OpenStac
 k deployments for NFV NGPoPs. The organization of this PDP contains a set 
 of upstreamed hooks to OpenStack/OSLO\, OpenDaylight/AAA\, and possibly Op
 enContrail in the future. It also proposed a reference implementation of t

DESCRIPTION:OPNFV Doctor is building a framework to have infrastructure ma
 intenance and upgrade done in interaction with the application running on 
 top of it. By having this\, the application is able to keep zero downtime 
 with its service during the operations as well as to be able to utilize ne
 w capabilities of the upgraded underlying compute nodes. Not only the appl
 ication benefits from this\, but also the infrastructure admin\, as he can
  even request to down scale the application. That is\, for rolling upgrade
 s in networking systems where there may not be sufficient resources to per
 form rolling upgrade\, e.g. due to strict Return on Investment (ROI) polic
 y for the special Telco hardware used. Using the proposed framework\, you 
 can first down scale the application to free capacity on your hardware for
  then triggering the rolling upgrade. Presentation shows how this and much
  more will be accomplished.

DESCRIPTION:Placement in OpenStack carries two fundamental issues that lim
 it its scalability. First\, Nova scheduler is too slow for large clouds\, 
 as it requires full knowledge of the system's state for its decisions. Sec
 ond\, the orchestration engine (Heat) enables launching multi-VM cloud app
 lications\, but deploys them one at a time since Nova lacks the required a
 pplication level awareness. This may lead to under-utilization and sub-opt
 imal performance.\nThis session addresses both issues. We will show a fast
 er alternative to Nova scheduler and an enhancement for application level 
 deployment. Through extensive evaluation on real datasets\, we will show t
 hat the new scheduler achieves up to x5.3 faster placements with similar q
 uality.  We will also show that our enhancement improves the performance 
 and acceptance ratio of network services.

DESCRIPTION:As the Verizon Wireless OpenStack Edge platform grows\, making
  efficient use of resources also grows in importance\, to deliver the cost
  benefits of OpenStack to Verizon customers. This presentation explores ho
 w utilization at the highest level\, Virtual Network Function (VNF) redund
 ancy pairs\, relates to utilizations at intermediate and lower levels. For
  example\, an intermediate level\, a nova server\, corresponds to a lower 
 level Libvirt instance\, which in turn is composed of CPU cores which each
  have utilizations. In some cases\, these CPU cores may be pinned by the V
 NF design\, and used at 100%\, in which case no optimization is possible. 
 In other cases\, some over-subscription may be possible without impacting 
 services. In addition to tying a given nova VM together with its foundatio
 nal levels\, each VNF frequently contains multiple nova instances\, neutro
 n networks\, and cinder volumes\, which also must be considered when over-
 subscribing.
