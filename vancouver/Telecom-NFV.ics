DESCRIPTION:The next wave of transformation for Telco Cloud is Hyper-conve
 rged NFV infrastructure (NFVi) which is expected to bring cost efficiency 
 and scale.  Storage is a key piece of any Hyper-converged platform and ne
 w solid-state storage technologies such as Intel Optane\, are bringing a b
 ig shift in compute vs storage budget balance in Hyper-converged platforms
 .  Intel and its Telco partners are collaborating on developing new ways 
 to leverage these technologies in Ceph to enable a low latency\, high perf
 ormance OpenStack platform for Telco NFV applications.  Join the team to 
 hear about our contributions to Ceph and Openstack-HELM and take away the 
 basics of tuning Hyper-converged Ceph.

SUMMARY:Open HPE Telco NFV-Infrastructure platforms with Red Hat OpenStack
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T183500Z
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T191500Z
UID:21815@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Telco NFV-Infrastructure transformation is about moving away f
 rom closed\, monolithic\, appliance-built network to a more open\, flexibl
 e infrastructure. An open\, agile\, and cloud native model will enable Com
 munication Service Providers (CSPs) to innovate\, deploy\, and manage new 
 services. HPE\, in partnership with Red Hat\, offers a new way for CSPs to
  design\, deploy\, and manage networking services from the Core out to the
  Edge. The new HPE NFV Blueprints are validated reference designs that com
 e with toolset that leverages open industry standards like Redfish to auto
 mate deployment and configuration of the NFVI stack. They help reduce comp
 lexity\, lower risk\, and enable faster time to value for CSPs to deploy t
 heir Telco NFV- Infrastructure. By decoupling the network functions from p
 roprietary hardware appliances and embracing virtualization and open indus
 try solutions\, CSPs can accelerate new\, compelling services in an effici
 ent\, cost‐effective model.

DESCRIPTION:OPNFV provides different ways to install OpenStack\, but also 
 provides multiple testing tools for OpenStack and\, soon\, even Kubernetes
 . Vendors who integrate OpenStack for service providers also need to know 
 how to validate that OpenStack is a fit for NFV requirements. This session
  is to be presented by two OPNFV Functest contributors who will detail how
  some components developed in OPNFV have been used to test/validate commer
 cial solutions in addition to the internal QA test. \nThe best practices l
 earned in OPNFV were used to design and build a CI chain including jenkins
 \, functest\, yardstick\, the test API and the Test DB.

DESCRIPTION:In this talk we will introduce the pre-integrated system defin
 ition and practice demo.China Mobile currently apply a distributed telecom
  cloud architecture. There are numerous edge telecom cloud nodes to be bui
 lt/operation/maintenance. The edge nodes are all based on OpenStack's thre
 e-layer decoupling architecture. We build the pre-integrated model to solv
 e the problem\, involving OPNFV integrated tools and ONAP remote operation
  management. That means firstly we build several pre-integrated edge TIC t
 emplate\, which is standardized/modular/scalable\, then batch production o
 f numbers of edge TICs\, deliver to many edge locations\, plug and play\, 
 remote operation/maintenance\, simplify local workload. In the demo\, we w
 ill show pre-integrated delivery verification in China Mobile NovoNet proj
 ect\, including the definition of pre-integrated templates (hardware and s
 oftware planning and design)\, template instantiation (system deployment\,
  integration testing\, etc.) and integrated delivery on-line.

SUMMARY:5G Network Slicing and OpenStack
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T221000Z
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T225000Z
UID:21300@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:One of the most exciting concepts in the 5G paradigm is the id
 ea of Network Slicing (NS). While NS has not been ratified as a standard a
 s of yet\, current drafts suggest NS requires the end to end network virtu
 alization and the ability to manage Quality of Service (QoS). Further\, as
  specified by various standards bodies\, NS effectively requires APIs exis
 t to manage it.\nMany of the major requirements of 5G NS are already satis
 fied by OpenStack networking\, such as QoS\, isolation\, segregation\, sha
 ring networks\, and of course\, automation/orchestration via Neutron APIs.
 \nIn this presentation we will review what NS is based on draft documents 
 by standards bodies\, as well as what requirements of NS are satisfied by 
 OpenStack. We will explore how OpenStack can be integrated in a SP network
  in order to enable NS. We will also demonstrate a simulated SP network an
 d what level of NS can currently be accomplished by OpenStack and Manageme
 nt and Orchestration (MANO) systems such as Open Baton.

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180522T000000Z
UID:20826@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:   One of the challenges for NFV is to achieve the performance
  as high as dedicated hardware. SR-IOV is used for such a purpose. However
 \, you lose the flexibility of virtualization because it highly depends on
  hardware.\n   DPDK is emerging solution for NFV\, but there are still dif
 ficulties to use it in OpenStack. This is because DPDK should be aware of 
 physical computing resources\, such as NIC ports\, CPU cores\, and NUMA no
 des.\n   In this talk\, we show how much the performance changes if those 
 physical resources are well tuned for optimization. We explain how to work
  around tuning difficulties in OpenStack giving an illustration of the usa
 ge of networking-spp. Networking-spp is a Neutron ML2 plugin for SPP (Soft
  Patch Panel). SPP is implemented on DPDK. It behaves like a patch panel a
 nd enables VNFs to communicate each other.\n   We also mention the remaini
 ng tasks for optimization and how they are going to be solved in the Place
 ment\, a resource management service from the Nova project.

UID:21708@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Placement in OpenStack carries two fundamental issues that lim
 it its scalability. First\, Nova scheduler is too slow for large clouds\, 
 as it requires full knowledge of the system's state for its decisions. Sec
 ond\, the orchestration engine (Heat) enables launching multi-VM cloud app
 lications\, but deploys them one at a time since Nova lacks the required a
 pplication level awareness. This may lead to under-utilization and sub-opt
 imal performance.\nThis session addresses both issues. We will show a fast
 er alternative to Nova scheduler and an enhancement for application level 
 deployment. Through extensive evaluation on real datasets\, we will show t
 hat the new scheduler achieves up to x5.3 faster placements with similar q
 uality.  We will also show that our enhancement improves the performance 
 and acceptance ratio of network services.

DESCRIPTION:NFV deployment is a multi-layered stack where a unified Orches
 trator such as ONAP takes the responsibility of closed-loop automation for
  the resilience of virtual network function (VNF). The closed-loop should 
 be event driven for both efficiency and accuracy. The closed-loop is trigg
 ered by some symptom usually coming from given alert or event.  Once trig
 gered\, a predefined policy is used to connect the symptom with proper rec
 over operations which is a status machine relying on events too. So\, the 
 design of event driven framework becomes the key of closed loop. VNFs are 
 often deployed and running on OpenStack for its rich resource management f
 unctions and API. To transfer the events from OpenStack to ONAP\, we need 
 to weave together various message bus systems and event sources. In this p
 resentation\, we will share an innovated framework which federates the eve
 nts/alerts/metrics across different layers and sources with a demo of clos
 ed-loop automation through typical NFV use cases.

 ts and ONAP will dig into what makes up the Anatomy of a Network Cloud. Th
 is will include\;\n1. The business use cases that are driving the evolutio
 n of the Network Cloud.\n2. The telecomunication industry's opensource app
 roach to serve this demand (e.g. OpenStack\, ONAP).\n3. The cloud software
  delivery capabilities\, processes\, automation and infrastructure needed 
 to build and maintain the Network Cloud (e.g. CI/CD of Cloud Infrastructur
 e).\n4. What the network cloud looks like today\, and what the next steps 
 are in its evolution.

DESCRIPTION:We have previously shown how OPNFV Barometer (Platform Service
  Assurance) can facilitate the adoption of NFV by providing the critical p
 latform and NFVI metrics required to detect and correct faults before serv
 ice outages occur.\nOutside of SA\, Barometer has proven quite useful by p
 roviding standardized metric sets for different applications fulfilling a 
 variety of purposes e.g.\, benchmarking\, Intelligent orchestration\, SUT 
 characterization/analysis\, etc\nThe OPNFV Bottlenecks project simulates e
 xtreme or long term product usage to verify if the SUT could survive to m
 eet some quality requirements which are based on the monitoring metrics.\n
 The OPNFV Yardstick project has made use of these same metrics in network 
 services benchmarking and for VNF characterization.\nThis talk will show h
 ow Barometer can be used in conjunction with Bottlenecks and Yardstick to 
 fulfill use cases beyond service assurance to further ease the transition 
 to NFV by promoting standardization and interoperability.

DESCRIPTION:As the Verizon Wireless OpenStack Edge platform grows\, making
  efficient use of resources also grows in importance\, to deliver the cost
  benefits of OpenStack to Verizon customers. This presentation explores ho
 w utilization at the highest level\, Virtual Network Function (VNF) redund
 ancy pairs\, relates to utilizations at intermediate and lower levels. For
  example\, an intermediate level\, a nova server\, corresponds to a lower 
 level Libvirt instance\, which in turn is composed of CPU cores which each
  have utilizations. In some cases\, these CPU cores may be pinned by the V
 NF design\, and used at 100%\, in which case no optimization is possible. 
 In other cases\, some over-subscription may be possible without impacting 
 services. In addition to tying a given nova VM together with its foundatio
 nal levels\, each VNF frequently contains multiple nova instances\, neutro
 n networks\, and cinder volumes\, which also must be considered when over-
 subscribing.

 orking-bgpvpn Neutron Stadium project plays to address this need\, from th
 e basics of the BGPVPN Interconnection API\, to more advanced uses made po
 ssible by evolutions of this API delivered in Queens.\nThe more interestin
 g use cases will be the opportunity for a step by step demo.\nWe'll give a
  status of where the project stands today in terms of feature coverage\, l
 ook at the set of SDN controllers providing an implementation for this API
  beyond the implementation in reference drivers\, and last\, look at the f
 uture of the project.

DESCRIPTION:As the Verizon Wireless OpenStack Edge platform grows\, making
  efficient use of resources also grows in importance\, to deliver the cost
  benefits of OpenStack to Verizon customers. This presentation explores ho
 w utilization at the highest level\, Virtual Network Function (VNF) redund
 ancy pairs\, relates to utilizations at intermediate and lower levels. For
  example\, an intermediate level\, a nova server\, corresponds to a lower 
 level Libvirt instance\, which in turn is composed of CPU cores which each
  have utilizations. In some cases\, these CPU cores may be pinned by the V
 NF design\, and used at 100%\, in which case no optimization is possible. 
 In other cases\, some over-subscription may be possible without impacting 
 services. In addition to tying a given nova VM together with its foundatio
 nal levels\, each VNF frequently contains multiple nova instances\, neutro
 n networks\, and cinder volumes\, which also must be considered when over-
 subscribing.
