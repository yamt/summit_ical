DESCRIPTION:OpenStack Upstream Institute is an intensive program designed 
 to share knowledge about the different ways of contributing to OpenStack l
 ike providing new features\, writing documentation\, participating in work
 ing groups\, and so forth. The educational program is built on the princip
 le of open collaboration and will teach the students how to find informati
 on and navigate the intricacies of the project’s technical tools and soc
 ial interactions in order to get the contributions accepted. The live one 
 and a half day class is focusing on hands-on practice like the students ca
 n use a development environment to work on real-life bug fixes or new feat
 ures and learn how to test\, prepare and upload them for review. The atten
 dees are also given the opportunity to join a mentoring program to get fur
 ther help and guidance on their journey to become an active and successful
  member of the OpenStack community.\n

DESCRIPTION:Session 1: 1:30 – 2:45\nInstall and Configure VMware Integra
 ted OpenStack\nInstructor: Henrik Blixt\nVMware integrated OpenStack is on
 e of the easiest OpenStack distributions to install and configure. In this
  first session you’ll do a (remote) hands-on install of VMware Integrate
 d OpenStack and experience it for yourself. We will also go through the ma
 in differences between VMware Integrated OpenStack and other OpenStack dis
 tributions\, including the benefits as well as the drawbacks.\nKey Take-aw
 ay:\n1.     Attendees will gain an understanding of how to install VMw
 are Integrated OpenStack.\n2.     Attendees will learn about the key b
 enefits of VMware Integrated OpenStack and unique advantages from other Op
 enStack distributions.\n \nSession 2: 3:00 – 4:15\nAdvanced Networking 
 with VMware Integrated OpenStack\nInstructor: Marcos Hernandez & Xiao Gao\
 nVMware NSX is one of the fastest growing segments at VMware and packed wi
 th advanced features. Networking is an important and integral part of Open
 Stack\, but also one of the most complex. Our NSX and OpenStack teams have
  always been working closely together and the result is a solution that gi
 ves you the best of both worlds.\nIn this session you will gain insight in
 to the key features of NSX\, the interaction with Neutron and how it all w
 orks in OpenStack. We will cover key areas including\, firewalls\, load ba
 lancers\, and micro-segmentation\, amongst other items and show how all th
 e pieces fit together.\nKey Take-away:\n1.     Attendees will gain an 
 understanding of the latest advanced networking features available in VMwa
 re Integrated OpenStack and NSX.\n2.     Attendees will learn how to s
 et up Neutron networking backed by NSX-T\n \nSession 3: 4:30 – 5:30\nCS
 Ps deploying VMware Integrated OpenStack for NFV\nInstructor: Vanessa Litt
 le\nCSPs are quickly adopting OpenStack as a standardized platform for des
 igning and deploying their VNFs. However\, the complexity of the required 
 networking combined with OpenStack can make this a daunting task.  If you
  are deploying VNFs\, VMware Integrated OpenStack\, with its VMware SDDC s
 tack and OpenStack APIs\, makes your life easier. Learn how to deploy mode
 l a VNF\, deploy it via an open sourced orchestrator on to VMware Integrat
 ed OpenStack with NSX quickly and easily in this lab.\nKey Take-away:\nAtt
 endees will learn how to model and deploy a simple multi-VDU VNF.\nAttende
 es will learn how to deploy a VNF within a  VMware Integrated OpenStack e
 nvironment using an open sourced orchestrator\nAttendees will learn the be
 nefits of VMware Integrated OpenStack in a Telco network\n \nSession 4: 5
