For usability, TStack has been refactored by micro-service architecture to enable CI\/CD. OpenStack has already enables its Kubernetes deployment with Helm and Kolla. As a cloud management system, TStack has also been refactored into containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes. We firstly share our feedbacks about this refactoring. OpenStack is considered as an ecosystem to integrate upper PaaS and SaaS to improve openness. IaaS is considered as a base for the whole cloud ecosystem. Tencent has developed a rich portfolio of PaaS and SaaS. Thanks to the reference architecture and standard interfaces of OpenStack, we can easily integrate PaaS and SaaS based on OpenStack. Horizontally, flexibility is achieved by combining both Tencent public cloud and TStack private cloud resources in a hybrid mode. With the modern usage of cloud, e.g. edge computing, the frontier between the public cloud and private cloud becomes dynamic, an application can be easily migrate from a private cloud to a public cloud or vice versa. Tencent also builds such a dynamic hybrid cloud solution based on its public and private cloud.<\/p>","start_epoch":1527096600,"end_epoch":1527099000,"start_datetime":"2018-05-23 17:30:00","end_datetime":"2018-05-23 18:10:00","start_time":"5:30pm","end_time":"6:10pm","date_nice":"Wed 23","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":350,"type_id":158,"rsvp_link":"","has_rsvp":false,"rsvp_external":true,"rsvp_seat_type":"N\/A","sponsors_id":[1074],"category_group_ids":[],"tags_id":[],"going":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"summit_id":24,"time_zone_id":"America\/Vancouver","attendees_schedule_count":13,"track_id":212,"attachment_url":"","to_record":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/vancouver-2018\/summit-schedule\/events\/21849\/tencent-tstacks-roadmap-with-openstack","social_summary":"Tencent TStack\u2019s Roadmap with OpenStack"},{"id":21756,"title":"TripleO and Ansible integration","class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p><span>During Rocky, TripleO plans to move to Ansible to drive and apply Overcloud configuration.
