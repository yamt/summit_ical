Having recognized that a number of significant obstacles continue to interfere with the ability of globally dispersed researchers to effectively collaborate. It focuses on the federation of data, identity, security, shared compute and storage; and an interoperable cloud services management platform. http:\/\/www.openresearchcloud.org\/<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The NIST Cloud Computing Program (NCCP) recognized, in the USG Cloud Computing Standards and Technology Roadmap (NIST SP 500-293), the importance of advancement and development of frameworks to support the seamless implementation of federated community cloud environments. In August 2017, the NCCP Public Working Group (PWG) on Federated Cloud (PWGFC) initiated a collaborative effort with the IEEE P2302 group, Standards for Intercloud Interoperability and Federation (SIIF), to advance Federated Cloud through the development of a conceptual architecture and a vocabulary. The IEEE P2302 will develop a standard based on the NIST model.

By leaving only the networking and compute functions to the client, we make the process of setting up a public cloud with highly available controller nodes a simple task. Using technologies like Ansible and Docker we are able to present each client with an isolated and independent OpenStack deployment, making management of multiple deployments almost a trivial job. <\/span><\/p>","start_epoch":1527183000,"end_epoch":1527185400,"start_datetime":"2018-05-24 17:30:00","end_datetime":"2018-05-24 18:10:00","start_time":"5:30pm","end_time":"6:10pm","date_nice":"Thu 24","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":351,"type_id":158,"rsvp_link":"","has_rsvp":false,"rsvp_external":true,"rsvp_seat_type":"N\/A","sponsors_id":[],"category_group_ids":[83],"tags_id":[4590,4591,4646,35,4603,34,4649,14],"going":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"summit_id":24,"time_zone_id":"America\/Vancouver","attendees_schedule_count":24,"track_id":213,"attachment_url":"","to_record":true,"url":"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/vancouver-2018\/summit-schedule\/events\/21359\/microclouds-for-fragmented-markets-getting-openstack-everywhere","social_summary":"Removing the entry barriers for OpenStack clouds in emerging markets.","speakers_id":[14283,11451],"moderator_id":0,"level":"Advanced","status":"accepted"},{"id":21475,"title":"Monitoring and Logging your kubernetes cluster using OpenStack helm","class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p>OpenStack adaptation towards microservice architecture with the help of kubernetes has now shifted its focus from \u201cInstalling Openstack to build your initial cloud\u201d to \u201cManaging the lifecycle of a cloud \u2013 scale out, upgrade and manage failures\u201d.

This presentation explores how utilization at the highest level, Virtual Network Function (VNF) redundancy pairs, relates to utilizations at intermediate and lower levels. For example, an intermediate level, a nova server, corresponds to a lower level Libvirt instance, which in turn is composed of CPU cores which each have utilizations. In some cases, these CPU cores may be pinned by the VNF design, and used at 100%, in which case no optimization is possible. In other cases, some over-subscription may be possible without impacting services. In addition to tying a given nova VM together with its foundational levels, each VNF frequently contains multiple nova instances, neutron networks, and cinder volumes, which also must be considered when over-subscribing.<\/p>","start_epoch":1527183000,"end_epoch":1527185400,"start_datetime":"2018-05-24 17:30:00","end_datetime":"2018-05-24 18:10:00","start_time":"5:30pm","end_time":"6:10pm","date_nice":"Thu 24","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":352,"type_id":158,"rsvp_link":"","has_rsvp":false,"rsvp_external":true,"rsvp_seat_type":"N\/A","sponsors_id":[],"category_group_ids":[83],"tags_id":[4593,4590,4591,4649,34,14,2080,964],"going":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"summit_id":24,"time_zone_id":"America\/Vancouver","attendees_schedule_count":45,"track_id":216,"attachment_url":"","to_record":true,"url":"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/vancouver-2018\/summit-schedule\/events\/21507\/steps-to-optimizing-openstack-resource-utilization-for-vnfs-tying-openstack-services-together","social_summary":"Correlating OpenStack, foundations and VNFs provides savings and reliability for Verizon customers.","speakers_id":[11065],"moderator_id":0,"level":"Beginner","status":"accepted"},{"id":21079,"title":"Tuning OpenStack for HPC - experiences from TH-2","class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p>In this session we will talk something&nbsp;about&nbsp;OpenStack based HPC ecosystem which is currently running on TianHe-2 Super computer.
