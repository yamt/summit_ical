DESCRIPTION:The self-service and dynamic nature of the cloud creates chall
 enges for risk and compliance professionals tasked with measuring and demo
 nstrating adherence to security and privacy controls. Traditional tools an
 d controls that worked well for security and compliance in the datacenter\
 , fail in the cloud. In this session\, we will the steps to achieving cont
 inuous cloud security governance for your OpenStack environment and its ho
 sted applications. First\, we will examine how to discover\, visualize\, a
 nd intuitively audit to uncover existing risks and threats. Second\, we wi
 ll implement cloud-native policy guardrails that identify\, alert on and r
 emediate risk. Third\, we will move to automated enforcement of these poli
 cies. This session will include demonstration of these techniques.

DESCRIPTION:Networking a Bare Metal cloud (using Ironic server deployments
 ) is more than just slapping VLANs on switch ports. If you need scale\, yo
 u need VXLAN &ndash\; even for bare metal cloud. \n \nHow does this mesh w
 ith pure software-based VXLAN deployments?\n \nThe latest SDN revolution i
 s centered on creating efficient virtualized data center networks using VX
 LAN & EVPN.  We will talk about the scale\, performance\, and cost advanta
 ges of using a modern controller-free virtualized network built on 100 Gig
 abit Ethernet switches with hardware based VXLAN Routing.   \nWe will expl
 ore how to automate such a network in an OpenStack environment and take yo
 u through a real world use case of using OpenStack Network Node bridging b
 etween a bare metal cloud (EVPN) and a fully virtualized cloud environment
 s (orchestrated by Neutron).

DESCRIPTION:CERN\, the European Organization for Nuclear Research\, is run
 ning for several years a large OpenStack Cloud that helps thousands of sci
 entists to analyze the data from the LHC.\nIn 2012\, early in the design p
 hase of the CERN Cloud we decided to use Nova Cells to enable the infrastr
 ucture to scale to thousands of nodes. Now with more than 280K cores sprea
 d across 70 cells that are hosted in two data centres we were faced with t
 he challenge to migrate to Nova Cells V2 required in the Pike release.\nIn
  this presentation\, we will describe how Nova Cells allowed CERN to scale
  to thousands of nodes\, its advantages and how we mitigate the implementa
 tion issues of Nova Cells V1. Next\, we will cover how we upgraded Nova fr
 om Newton with Cells V1 to Pike with Cells V2. We will explain the steps t
 hat we followed and the issues that we faced during the upgrade. Finally\,
  we will report our experience with Cells V2 at scale\, its caveats and ho
 w we are mitigate them.

DESCRIPTION:Managing OpenStack environments requires visibility and observ
 ability. However many OpenStack deployments have limited monitoring tools 
 and as a result enginteers lack visibility into the workings of the OpenSt
 ack environment. In this track you will learn about an OpenStack native mo
 nitoring tool called Monasca (Monitoring As A Service At Scale) that provi
 des visibility into OpenStack environments. Monasca provides visibility of
  compute\, block storage\, image service\, authentication\, networking\, a
 nd more. In this presentation we plan to cover:- A tour of OP5's implement
 ation of Monasca- How to deploy Monasca on bare metal and within OpenStack
 - Best practices for OpenStack monitoringAbout OP5OP5 has developed an ent
 erprise level monitoring solution with full support for OpenStack. It is b
 ased upon the OpenStack project Monasca\, meaning a high performing scalab
 le fault tolerant solution from start.Monasca is based on microservice arc
 hitecture which enables high scalability\, both horizontally and verticall
 y\, and as a result OP5's monitoring solution is able to process millions 
 of metrics per second.OP5's monitoring solution for OpenStack can also han
 dle constant data streams being both pulled and pushed from within the env
 ironment. The architecture is built on a highly-performant message bus cap
 able of ingesting a constant flow of data streams as opposed to a master-s
 lave polling for events.Our solution supports agent authentication through
  Keystone\, a OpenStack authentication project. The use of tenants make it
  possible to separate authentication and authorization on a per-project-ba
 sis\, and It makes it possible to separate departments or customers sharin
 g the same platform\, giving a reliable\, multi-tenant solution.In the sam
 e vein as OP5's other monitoring solutions\, this is based upon robust API
 s enabling integrations with other applications for analytics and visualiz
 ation\, such as Grafana.

 illion active users\, where fair share of the service components are being
  hosted on our 2 private OpenStack-based clouds that are currently in a 50
 .000+ cores scale range\, and growing rapidly.\nAs our cloud expanded into
  new regions\, in order to achieve better scalability\, we had established
  a CLOS type network underlay all the way from top level fabric routers to
  the hypervisor itself\, while keeping our cloud architecture fairly simpl
 e.\n In this new architecture\, the Hypervisor would exchange routes to it
 s VMs with ToR switches\, thus providing the VMs with the external L3 conn
 ectivity and completely isolating L2 traffic between instances\, on hyperv
 isor and cloud level. Neutron currently does not support such use-case\, s
 o we had implemented a custom plugin and agent to make it possible. \nIn t
 his session we will explain how we had implemented such solution in Neutro
 n.

 r connecting\, managing and securing microservices.   With services runnin
 g in multiple clouds\, service mesh has to be established across the cloud
 s.   In this presentation John and Tim will show how an application can be
  stretched between two disparate cloud environments--public cloud and an O

 . This setup eases the burden of user account administration within OpenSt
 ack providing users access to the Horizon dashboard and OpenStackClient to
 ols using existing FreeIPA credentials. We describe the development of a s
 elf service web portal for users to manage an API key\, a new authenticati
 on plugin for keystone\, and integrating an OAuth2/OpenID consent endpoint
  for FreeIPA. Access control is provided by a custom ACL extension in the 
 federated keystone driver pulling groups and projects directly from FreeIP
 A. This work is supported by Aristotle\, a NSF DIBBs funded federated clou

 or both OpenStack and Kubernetes. Effort to leverage external system such 
 as Apache Fortress was considered\, but the introduction of java to both O

DESCRIPTION:Upgrading directly from Juno to Ocata is something the OpenSta
 ck community never intended for anyone to do\, however we at Oath managed 
 it with almost zero impact on our customers. A key piece of this task was 
 running five database migrations across three components (Nova\, Glance\, 
 and Keystone)\, which took about an hour. Related work leading up to this 
 migration was the re-imaging of almost 1\,000 HVs to upgrade the OS and Li
 bvirt\, and also migrating our custom patches and plugins to work with the
  Ocata code base. During this entire process\, any given VM was only down 
 for a few hours during the HV upgrade\, while the Nova API had even less d
 owntime. We are currently expanding on this work for the Juno to Ocata upg
 rade of Ironic and Neutron in our Bare Metal clusters and will publish det
 ails on this at a later date.

 NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol)is a much better alternative for connec
 tivity than multiple site to site VPN tunnels to form a mesh. It provides 
 a mechanism to enable a fully meshed network between the different endpoin
 ts using multipoint GRE and IPSec. A Routing protocol is used to exchange 
 Route information. The dynamic nature of the protocol minimizes configurat

DESCRIPTION:Access control plays a very important role for both the cloud

  Role Based Access Control rules are fixed before deployment on an OpenSta

 al and tedious process that causes consistency issues across 100s of deplo
 yment and ends up in creating a snow flake deployment environment. Since g
 ranular roles are not available\, users are tend to be given privileged ro
 les. Higher privilege access causes a lot of issues including inadvertent 
 deletes\, access to  tenant data\, and other security issues. With Dynami
 c RBAC\, it provides the flexibility for Cloud Administrators to define st
 ringent RBAC rules in real time and apply/activate these roles immediately
  eliminating the need to the next deployment cycle and tightening any secu

DESCRIPTION:Upgrading directly from Juno to Ocata is something the OpenSta
 ck community never intended for anyone to do\, however we at Oath managed 
 it with almost zero impact on our customers. A key piece of this task was 
 running five database migrations across three components (Nova\, Glance\, 
 and Keystone)\, which took about an hour. Related work leading up to this 
 migration was the re-imaging of almost 1\,000 HVs to upgrade the OS and Li
 bvirt\, and also migrating our custom patches and plugins to work with the
  Ocata code base. During this entire process\, any given VM was only down 
 for a few hours during the HV upgrade\, while the Nova API had even less d
 owntime. We are currently expanding on this work for the Juno to Ocata upg
 rade of Ironic and Neutron in our Bare Metal clusters and will publish det
 ails on this at a later date.

DESCRIPTION:In OpenStack ecosystem\, we have a lot of tools that help dev 
 and ops in monitoring\, logging and debugging. However\, they are all lack
  of request flow.\nUnder Oslo umbrella\, we have OSProfiler - a small libr
 ary that focus on tracing. This library will be an additional tool (beside
  monitoring\, logging\, ...) for dev/ops to enhance their OpenStack system
 .\nOSProfiler can record flow of request and display it as a timeline grap
 h. This graph contains information to determine/find perfomance bottleneck
 \, errors and exceptions in that request. Tracing data can be stored in ba
 ckends like redis\, mongodb\, elasticsearch\, loginsight and even file.\nI
 n this short talk\, I will present to you basic about OSProfiler. Hope tha
 t it will help.

DESCRIPTION:Security is at once the most consistent and most rapidly chang
 ing topic in cloud infrastructure. In this session\, veteran security jour
 nalist Sean Michael Kerner will lead a conversation with a panel of commun
 ity members\, each of whom come at the topic of security from a unique poi
 nt of view.\nIn this session\, we’ll talk about: • Did the Meltdown/S
 pectre vulnerabilities impact OpenStack-based clouds more or less than any
 one else\, and was the response to the threat sufficient to meet the chall
 enge? • Security groups in OpenStack: useful innovation or a critical c
 atch-up feature? • What are the most common security threats to OpenSta
 ck? • OpenStack security checkup? What are the roadmap priorities with 
 respect to security? • Vulnerabilities on the horizon: where should we 
 place our priorities as a community of developers? • What priorities sh
 ould users have for hardening their security: the application level (user 
 workloads) or the organization level (formal agreements with cloud users t
 o address cloud privacy\, security\, and reliability)? • What role\, if
  any\, do GDPR and other regulatory influences play in OpenStack security 
 considerations?\nIf you follow Sean\, you know he asks tough\, focused and
  fair questions. Join this session if you’re looking for an illuminating
  and informative overview of the security landscape in OpenStack.

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack's approach to monitoring VM's has traditionally been
  a very 'black box' approach.  VNF Managers have played the role of map
 ping between a VM's  Application-Specific state and OpenStack's manageme
 nt of the VM.  Recent work  in the OpenStack Masakari project has start
 ed to look at leveraging a simple standardized  API between an OpenStack
  compute host and it's hosted Guest VMs. Such work enables  capabilities
  as 'active' / white-box type monitoring of the VM and Applications within
  the VM\,  graceful notifications of potentially service-affecting admin
 istrative commands on the VM\,  and even the ability to NACK these poten
 tially service-affecting commands if the HA VM is  not fully synchronize
 d with it's peer VM. In this session we'll discuss the pros and cons of 
  such an approach\, and provide a simple demo of these capabilities.

DESCRIPTION:Virtualization technology adds complexity to the cloud platfor
 m\, and the evaluation of the cloud platform is therefore more difficult. 
 Now most of the existing evaluation system of cloud computing only test on
 e aspect of the performance for the cloud platform and the evaluation mode
 l is not general. To solve this\, we built a Comprehensive，general evalu
 ation system model：\n\nPerformance test: CPU、Memory\, Storage\, Networ
 k\, VPN\, Load Balancing\, Firewalls and so on.\nStability Assessment: Foc
 uses on the stability of virtual machines in terms of computational perfor
 mance\, memory performance\, network performance\, and storage performance
 .\nScenario Based Assessment: Measure the performance using representative
  real-world workloads（based on HPC and YCSB ）to provides Elasticity an
 d Scalability \nMonitoring and Metering: In cloud platform\, all kinds o
 f resources and services should be monitored and metered.\n\n \n

DESCRIPTION: \nThe Multicloud is a reality with users balancing the need 
 for specialized services\, High Availability\, Elasticity\, Security among
  other things to drive to a solution that solves business needs. Minimizin
 g the complexity for secure connectivity across the various endpoints is c
 ritical to ensure that networking does not overwhelm the deployment.\nOpen
 NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol)is a much better alternative for connec
 tivity than multiple site to site VPN tunnels to form a mesh. It provides 
 a mechanism to enable a fully meshed network between the different endpoin
 ts using multipoint GRE and IPSec. A Routing protocol is used to exchange 
 Route information. The dynamic nature of the protocol minimizes configurat
 ion changes with changes to the topology. We share our experience along wi
 th a demo illustrating an Enterprise application running in a OpenStack Pr
 ivate cloud as the Hub interacting with components spread across some repr
 esentative Public Clouds as Spokes.\n

DESCRIPTION:Galaxy is a multi-cloud validation tool which aims to minimize
  the mean time to detect issues on any number of cloud across Openstack.
  It is a Python based application which is easily pluggable to existing cl
 ouds. Openstack clouds are complex in architecture and comprises of seve
 ral loosely coupled components working in sync to function as a single 
 entity. The idea behind this tool is to substantiate the results of the O
 penstack components health and perform validations of all kinds required t
 o declare the health of the cloud. \nThis tool enables user to triage an 
 issue related to Openstack clouds/ components in a matter of few mins. It 
 also provides transparency to the end user\, who would like to know if he/
 she has lost a node\, or vm\, or has any major rack failures.

DESCRIPTION:Access control plays a very important role for both the cloud 
 providers and tenants to make optimal use of the OpenStack Features. Today
  Role Based Access Control rules are fixed before deployment on an OpenSta
 ck instance into a datacenter. Any changes to these roles\, is a very manu
 al and tedious process that causes consistency issues across 100s of deplo
 yment and ends up in creating a snow flake deployment environment. Since g
 ranular roles are not available\, users are tend to be given privileged ro
 les. Higher privilege access causes a lot of issues including inadvertent 
 deletes\, access to  tenant data\, and other security issues. With Dynami
 c RBAC\, it provides the flexibility for Cloud Administrators to define st
 ringent RBAC rules in real time and apply/activate these roles immediately
  eliminating the need to the next deployment cycle and tightening any secu
 rity loop holes.
