DESCRIPTION:The past few Forums have really helped shape a way forward for
  fixing some of the RBAC issues across OpenStack. These issues hinder an e
 ntire set of people from using OpenStack without major modifications and c
 ustom policies. During the PTG we settled on an approach that should make 
 it easier for deployers looking to have common personas available out-of-t
 he-box. The current proposal [0] is getting positive feedback from other O
 penStack developers and we'd like to take the opportunity to socialize thi
 s work with operators and deployers. [0] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/

DESCRIPTION:Again I will be proposing a release goal (this time for the St
 ein release) for the migration of projects to StoryBoard. Concerns last pr
 oposal was that there weren't enough projects or large projects that had b
 een migrated. Ironic has since migrated (along with at least a half a doze
 n other smaller projects) and TripleO is currently doing a phased migratio
 n of a few squads at a time. This discussion will be focused on gathering 
 feedback from users and identifying main blockers stopping remaining proje
 cts from migrating. The focus will be come up with the last set of blocker
 s and a plan to remove them so that the remainder of projects can migrate 
 by the end of the Stein release.

  user requirements/expectation or not.  Since QA is not included in the us

 eople in the Users and Operators community that use OpenStack QA tools and
  learn\n How they are being used\n What we could do better \n What other Q

SUMMARY:A New Face and Place for the OpenStack Mentoring Program

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T220000Z
UID:21726@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Mentoring has always been a big part of the OpenStack Communit
 y and the time has come for changes. Historically\, the Women of OpenStack
  have owned and run the mentoring program that our community offers to new
  comers. However\, in order to reach a wider audience and to remove any th
 oughts that the program was women only\, we are looking to move the Long T
 erm Mentoring program out from under the Women of OpenStack to a new home.
  Potential groups that already exist that could own/help manage it are: Fi
 rst Contact SIG or Diversity WG.  In addition to a new overlord\, the form
 at of the program itself could use updates. Previously\, there was a 1 men
 tee to 1 mentor ratio that would often struggle for want of a defined goal
  and slow downs when the mentor would switch jobs or be on vacation. The p
 roposed new format will use cohorts to mentor community members and help t
 hem to would require fewer overall mentors helping mentees work towards a 
 defined common goal.  So what does this mean for you? We need one or more 
 volunteers to help get the new program off the ground and oversee the new 
 mentoring program. To be involved from the ground up- helping design what 
 it should look like\, what goals are\, recruiting mentors and mentees- and
  continuing to support the program into the future.

DESCRIPTION:In the past few cycles\, the Blazar team has focused on reserv
 ation of compute resources\, i.e. instances and hosts. Starting from the R
 ocky cycle\, the team is investigating support for reserving other kinds o
 f resources\, e.g. network resources. However\, the requirements for "What
 " and "How" users reserve and provision a reserved resource are different 
 based on the user's background and specific use cases. We assume there is 
 a diverse set of additional requests and requirements for such reservation
  service. This forum session covers the followings items:\n What additiona
 l resources (and with which characteristics) do you want to reserve?\n vir
 tual resource: network (floating IP addresses\, subnets\, bandwith\, etc.)
 \, volume (volume storage)\, or another resource?\n physical resource: net
 work (bandwith in host?)\, PCI-passthrough devices\, etc.\n How to create 
 a reservation and how to provision a reserved resource?\n Do users create 
 their reserved resource with reservation-id (this is a way the instance/ho
 st reservations do)?\n Does Blazar create their reserved resource at start
 _time and assign the resource to the user?\n Resource utilization\n  In ad
 dition\, we would like to receive feedback from Blazar operators about the
  current instance and host reservation features.

DESCRIPTION:Since its creation in early 2016\, within Nova\, there's alway

 done to make it happen\, including:\nGathering feedback from operators and
  deployers on their concerns and plans.\nDetailing the several options for
  managing data migrations.\nDetermining which of those are the best.\nMana
 ging standard resource classes (probably with an os-resource-classes libra

 activities have been focused on helping out new contributors looking to do
  code development. Given that contribution encompasses all kinds of other 
 activities besides development\, we want to be a group that supports more 
 types of contribution. This discussion will begin with a state of the unio
 n on resources that exist for new contributors and where we have gaps in t
 hose resources. The goal of the session is to come out of discussions with
  a better feel for resources that exist to help support new contributors t

DESCRIPTION:Over the past few year we've increasingly been relying on data

 job results. With things like elastic recheck\, subunit2sql\, openstack-he
 alth\, and grafana we've got an increasing number of tools to track result
 s and provide insights into what's happening in the gate. But\, even with 
 all this data capture a great deal of the analysis has to happen by hand i
 n these systems. Either by identifying things to track or combing through 
 the data to find points of interest. It would be great if we could automat
 e as much of that as possible\, which is an a good application for machine
  learning. This session is about bootstraping a community effort to build 
 tooling to apply machine learning techniques to our CI results analysis to
  provide useful insights in an automated manner.

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180522T000000Z
UID:21718@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:A recently proposed spec to Cinder suggests using a database t
 o avoid raciness when multiple schedulers are used in the Cinder environme
 nt. The described raciness is the result of each scheduler having an indep
 endent view of the available resources in the environment. This problem ca
 n be solved by having a single authoritative service for tracking resource
  inventory and usage. Placement does this. This session will bring Placeme
 nt and Cinder community members together to determine how Cinder can use P
 lacement. We will:\n Help Placement developers understand how scheduling c
 urrently works in Cinder.\n Help Cinder developers understand what Placeme
 nt can do.\n Develop short and medium term plans to get started with makin
 g it real.\n This session will also be great for other projects interested
  in learning how Placement can be leveraged for some of their needs\, and 
 hopefully provide an example of how to introduce Placement into their proj
 ects.

 cloud/NFV operators to align on what is needed and what is planned to be d

 \, we (Cyborg developers) propose to engage with the operators on the foll
 owing focus areas. Other topics are welcome to be added.\n What use cases 
 are the operators interested in\, and in what priority?What workloads and 
 bitstreams do they think is essential for a cloud FPGA service? \n Do they
  plan to develop their own IP to any extent\, or will rely on 3rd parties?
 \n For 3rd party bitstreams\, how do they plan to validate the bitstreams\
 , if at all?\n There is a train of thought that IP developers will hold th
 eir bitstreams confidential and not share with operators. OTOH\, operators
  may want to validate the bitstream first before even adding it to their r
 epo. What is their take?\nTheir top concerns/challenges and priorities\, a

  alerts when a problem occurs or when metrics/trends signal that the envir
 onment is not in optimal condition any more\, as Monasca is part of OpenSt
 ack it provides multi-tenancy and the ability to expose the metrics to Ope
 nStack users. The Monasca team is interested in collecting ideas from actu
 al and potential users\, we are looking for user stories to understand wha
 t is missing or can be improved in our solution\, what stops operators to 
 use Monasca and go for other monitoring and logging systems.  The Monasca 
 team is open to discuss with other teams about the current level of integr

 Cloud\, lee@aero.org Dr. Martial Michel\, Data Machines\, Inc.\, martialmi
 chel@datamachines.io Dr. Khalil Yazdi\, Yazdi and Associates Dr. Robert Bo
 hn\, National Institute of Standards and TechnologyPurpose Determine how t
 he OpenStack Community can partner with the NIST/IEEE Joint WG on Federate
 d Cloud\, and the Open Research Cloud Alliance (ORCA)\, to develop support
  for general cloud federation\, and enable a wide range of collaborative a
 pplication domains at any level in the software stack: IaaS\, PaaS\, or Sa
 aS.Background The momentum around cloud federation continues to grow. The 
 NIST/IEEE Joint WG on Federated Cloud [1\,2\,3] has been running for almos
 t seven months now\, and recently held their first workshop [4] to report-
 out on current work and invite stakeholders to review\, comment\, help in 
 charting the course of future work. The Open Research Cloud Alliance [5] h
 as been actively developing consensus across the scientific community stak
 eholders and will be holding their 4th Open Research Cloud Congress at the
  Vancouver Summit. The Open Geospatial Consortium will also be kicking-off
  their Testbed-14 [6] project in April which has a federated cloud task to
  demonstrate specific geospatial data sharing scenarios. This Forum topic 
 will continue the discussion around cloud federation started at the OpenSt
 ack Summit Forum in Sydney [7\,8]. Keystone\, OpenStack and the OpenStack 
 community are in a unique position to take a leadership position and make 
 significant contributions to this process. Keystone has already built-out 
 basic support to "federate-in" identities and "federate-out" OpenStack ser
 vices. With modest additional capabilities Keystone could support general 
 federations across multiple administrative domains [9] at any level in the
  system stack\, i.e.\, IaaS\, Paas\, and SaaS. This would facilitate a wid
 e variety of collaborations\, including areas as diverse as international 
 "big science" collaborations\, international disaster response\, and suppl
 y chain management\, just to name a few. This discussion session will cent
 er around possible federation deployment and governance models that could 
 be built-out in Keystone that embody the key concepts and design principle
 s being developed in the NIST/IEEE Joint WG and ORCA. The success of these
  efforts will depend directly on engaging with cloud builders\, operators\
 , and stakeholders. We welcome the opportunity to pursue this goal with th
 e OpenStack community.\n[1] Press Release: http://standards.ieee.org/news/

 are sharing architecture\, use cases\, gap analysis\, OSS for collecting/a
 nalyzing/storing/notifying\, related projects. OPNFV and ONAP has Doctor[8
 ]\, Barometer[9] and DCAE[10] that focus on monitoring and fault managemen
 t. We can also discuss how to adapt these projects to your environments. A
 nd the goal of this forum is sharing of real use cases requiring such faul

DESCRIPTION:Join members of the Technical Committee to discuss effectively
  evaluating applications from projects that want to be "official" OpenStac
 k projects. Each time an application happens there is extensive discussion
  about what it means to be official and how any individual applications fi
 ts into the bigger picture of what we are trying to create in OpenStack. W
 e shouldn't move the goalposts during an application\, but then we forget 
 to talk about the difficulties again until the next time an application ha
 ppens. In this session\, we'll remember and reflect on all the things said
  in conversations like http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack
 -tc/%23openstack-tc.2018-03-29.log.html#t2018-03-29T15:04:56 but discuss t
 hem outside the context of an individual application\, hopefully reaching 
 some clarity on how to effectively evaluate applications for fit and the g
 rowth of OpenStack.

  project itself\, the code structure/ overall architecture\, etc\, and pla
 ces where contribution is needed. Attendees will also get to know some of 
 the core contributors and other established community members.\n \nIdeall
 y\, attendees will know/ have completed the basics of contribution (i.e. i
 rc\, gerrit\, Launchpad\, StoryBoard\, Foundation Membership) BEFORE atten

DESCRIPTION:The Queens release was a big step forward for providing a base
  unified limit and quota strategy in OpenStack. A set of projects dedicate
 d time during the Dublin PTG to help shape what the next steps for unified
  limits looks like across the services. The main goal of this session is t
 o socialize the outcomes of what was discussed in Dublin with operators. I
 n addition to that we are going to ask operators who are using multi-tenan
 cy how they expect a system like this to behave.

DESCRIPTION:While they are under separate technical governance models\, th
 e various projects under the OpenStack Foundation (OpenStack and Kata Cont
 ainers in particular) need to paint a valuable overarching complementary s
 tory. The first step is to get to know each other better and explore the c
 omplementary points between the various pieces. A forum session is probabl
 y the best venue for such a cross-community discussion. Moderators: Thierr
 y Carrez\, Jeremy Stanley

SUMMARY:Advanced RCA use cases - taking Vitrage to the next level

DESCRIPTION:Vitrage is the OpenStack Root Cause Analysis service\, that he
 lps the cloud administrator understand and manage the faults that happen i
 n the cloud.  Vitrage is already used in production environments\, and it 
 supports several use cases: alarm deduction\, root cause analysis\, and to
 gether with Mistral it can provide recovery actions.  Now that the technol
 ogy is mature\, let's think about the next step. How can we enhance Vitrag
 e to provide even more value to the end users? What other use cases can be
  supported\, and how? We will be happy to hear from all our users about th
 eir experience and use cases. We would like to brainstorm and decide about
  new features that can be added to Vitrage.

SUMMARY:Vitrage RCA over K8s. Pets and Cattle - Monitor each cow?
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180524T234000Z
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180525T002000Z

DESCRIPTION:In the Rocky release\, Vitrage provides root cause analysis ov
 er k8s clusters. At this point\, it considers the k8s nodes but does not g
 et to the pods granularity. The purpose of this forum discussion is to con
 sider leveraging Vitrage topology and RCA to include services and pods. We
  hope to get feedback from users about their needs and use cases. We will 
 discuss the pros and cons of adding pods to Vitrage topology (enhanced RCA
  vs. performance etc.) and think about the optimal solution for adding it 
 in Vitrage Stein release.\n
