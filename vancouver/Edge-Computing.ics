DESCRIPTION:OpenStack's Virtualized Guests require the same security featu
 res as their physical counterparts. Intel's Trusted Execution Technology (
 TXT)along with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) provides a security anchor 
 for physical hosts by taking secure measurements of software and platformc
 omponents\, securing boot and interface keys\, as well as securing passwor
 ds.In this session\, we discuss and demo a secure approach at leveraging t
 he software-based virtual TPM\, in an OpenStack environment\, to provide t
 he same security capabilities to the much more dynamic cloud environment.

DESCRIPTION: \n \nIan Jolliffe\, Brent Rowsell and Dean Troyer will prov
 ide a deep dive of the StarlingX architecture and features.  We will disc
 uss the status of the code base today and some of the things we believe a
 re on the to-do list.  We hope to engage the community in a conversation 
 on how to integrate fully into the OpenStack community and ecosystem.\nSta
 rlingX is open source software that provides cloud infrastructure for the 
 most demanding applications in edge\, industrial IOT\, and telecom use cas
 es. It is based on code contributed by Intel and Wind River and combines c
 omponents of its own with leading open source projects such as OpenStack\
 , Ceph and OVS.Based on five generations of production software\, this see
 d code will be the base for future fully open source implementations that 
 can be productized. In addition to standard cloud functionality\, the proj
 ect components provide fault management and service management amongst ot
 hers to ensure high availability of user applications.The code release is 
 in process and available under the Apache 2 license.\n

DESCRIPTION:Telexistence is a fundamental concept named for the general te
 chnology that enables a human being to have a real-time sensation of being
  at a place other than where he or she actually exists\, and being able to
  interact with the remote environment\, which may be real\, virtual\, or a
  combination of both. It is an advanced and emerging technology in robotic
 s\, which combines Virtual Reality\, Remote Sensing\, Real-time Communicat
 ion\, Cloud Networking\, Machine Learning\, Humanoid Robots together. With
  the rapid development of telecommunication\, especially 5G\, edge computi
 ng\, IOT infrastructure\, telexistence is becoming realistic and producibl
 e\, rather than cinematic concept or research topic.\nAs a startup company
  in telexistence\, we would love to share our knowledge and ideas about ho
 w to build a large-scale and distributed cloud networking control plane de
 dicated to telexistence in days. The most important point is that this SDN
  architecture is fully powered by OpenStack.

 es are put close tothe end users (Edge). In such context OpenStack's contr
 ol plane can be spreadover many different locations. As a consequence its 
 internal management trafficcan go through a Wide Area Network made of hete
 rogeneous and possibleunreliable network links.\nThe session is about a st
 udy made under the umbrella of the FEMDC andperformance team and targets 
 a deep evaluation of the communicationlayer of OpenStack in massively dist
 ributed environments. This includes anevaluation of different messaging te
 chnologies (broker and brokerlessapproaches) while distributing ten thousa
 nds of agents over several(micro-)datacenters. The presentation also focus
 es on the messaging patternsoffered by Oslo.Messaging and the methodology 
 used. We will conclude on theidentified gaps and provide freely all the ma
 terial (tools and results) to the community.

UID:21483@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:5G standards are designed to take advantage of virtualization 
 and edge computing. They are meant to adapt automatically to changes in de
 mand. The massively distributed clouds that result will be complex and th
 ere are many implementation decisions to make.\nThe scale of 5G network\, 
 the distribution of the control function\, reemphasize not just the need f
 or automation but also the benefits of AI and predictive analytics. \nAut
 omation will be built in multiple systems that have complementary but some
 time overlapping scope. Openstack is one of them. The variety of architect
 ures result in a variety of options.\nAutoscaling is a good example of suc
 h automation. Some of this logic will be built into the application layer 
 possibly by a specialized microservice. But some of it can be built at the
  network layer in some Master orchestrator such as ONAP. Still some may al
 so be built at the node level\, in the Virtual infrastructure manager or i
 n Openstack. \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Openstack has been the leading Cloud option for VIM in most MA
 NO implementaions. The OPNFV chose Openstack and so did ONAP\,  and OpenBa
 ton. The preference was clear for Telco and NFV Vendors and now the same i
 s reflected in Edge Computing. What is there and what is not has baffled e

 e case selections for the Edge Computing a work in progress. This can be d
 irectly resolved by an architetcural view of ONAP as it dwells into Edge C
 omputing requirents from MEC to production grade demanded by Cloud and Com

DESCRIPTION:The advent of 5G will change the communications industry by en
 abling placement of high-bandwidth and low-latency mobile services at the 
 edge of the network. Additionally\, 5G will allow deployment of both virtu
 alized RAN (Radio Access Network) and CN (Core Network) at the Edge\, ther
 eby opening a way to expose many of these mobile services capabilities t
 hrough APIs.\nThese APIs will be used by the 3rd party applications such a
 s AR/VR\, IoT\, media etc. It is expected that the exposure of network AP
 Is at the Edge will drive further innovation.\nIn this presentation\, we w
 ill share:\nVarious architectural options for exposing APIs at the Edge to
  be consumed by both Telco and Web applications.\nHow OpenStack can be uti
 lized to deploy the various architectural options for exposing APIs?\nEdge
  cloud placement of analytics that will leverage local information in rea
 l-time.\nHow analytics at the Edge can be utilized to manage the distribut
 ed infrastructure by utilizing OpenStack\, Kubernetes etc.?\n\nWhat can I 
 expect to learn?\nThe audience is expected to gain the following from this
  presentation:\nVarious options for exposing mobility and network services
  APIs at the edge of the network.\nHow various network APIs can be consume
 d by the 3rd party application developers?\nManagement of context informat
 ion at the Edge.\nHow can OpenStack be utilized to deploy various network 
 components to support the network exposure of APIs?\nHow real-time analyti

 ct data sharing\, backhaul interconnect\, maintenance and etc. By evolving
  to an edge-optimized architecture\, we can help textile industry improve 
 fabric quality\, reduce operation cost and increase production efficiency.
  In this session\, I’ll share:\nWhat’s edge computing and why it’s i
 mportant to intelligence manufacturing\nWhat’s the characteristics\, str
 engths and weaknesses of traditional fabric defect detection method\nWhy t
 extile industry can benefit from edge computing infrastructure\nHow to des

DESCRIPTION:5G standards are designed to take advantage of virtualization 
 and edge computing. They are meant to adapt automatically to changes in de
 mand. The massively distributed clouds that result will be complex and th
 ere are many implementation decisions to make.\nThe scale of 5G network\, 
 the distribution of the control function\, reemphasize not just the need f
 or automation but also the benefits of AI and predictive analytics. \nAut
 omation will be built in multiple systems that have complementary but some
 time overlapping scope. Openstack is one of them. The variety of architect
 ures result in a variety of options.\nAutoscaling is a good example of suc
 h automation. Some of this logic will be built into the application layer 
 possibly by a specialized microservice. But some of it can be built at the
  network layer in some Master orchestrator such as ONAP. Still some may al
 so be built at the node level\, in the Virtual infrastructure manager or i
 n Openstack. \n \n

UID:21101@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Openstack has been the leading Cloud option for VIM in most MA
 NO implementaions. The OPNFV chose Openstack and so did ONAP\,  and OpenBa
 ton. The preference was clear for Telco and NFV Vendors and now the same i
 s reflected in Edge Computing. What is there and what is not has baffled e
 ven the ardent followers of Edge Computing. The pace of change has made us
 e case selections for the Edge Computing a work in progress. This can be d
 irectly resolved by an architetcural view of ONAP as it dwells into Edge C
 omputing requirents from MEC to production grade demanded by Cloud and Com
 munication Service Providers.\nThe Presentaion will focus on \n1. ONAP R2 
 Architecture and moving to R3 and its Requirments for Edge computing use c
 ases\n2.  Role  of Federation for Edge Computing with latency and throughp
 ut considerations\n3. What Openstack can provide to ONAP to leverage for E
 dge Cloud Infrastructure.

DESCRIPTION:The advent of 5G will change the communications industry by en
 abling placement of high-bandwidth and low-latency mobile services at the 
 edge of the network. Additionally\, 5G will allow deployment of both virtu
 alized RAN (Radio Access Network) and CN (Core Network) at the Edge\, ther
 eby opening a way to expose many of these mobile services capabilities t
 hrough APIs.\nThese APIs will be used by the 3rd party applications such a
 s AR/VR\, IoT\, media etc. It is expected that the exposure of network AP
 Is at the Edge will drive further innovation.\nIn this presentation\, we w
 ill share:\nVarious architectural options for exposing APIs at the Edge to
  be consumed by both Telco and Web applications.\nHow OpenStack can be uti
 lized to deploy the various architectural options for exposing APIs?\nEdge
  cloud placement of analytics that will leverage local information in rea
 l-time.\nHow analytics at the Edge can be utilized to manage the distribut
 ed infrastructure by utilizing OpenStack\, Kubernetes etc.?\n\nWhat can I 
 expect to learn?\nThe audience is expected to gain the following from this
  presentation:\nVarious options for exposing mobility and network services
  APIs at the edge of the network.\nHow various network APIs can be consume
 d by the 3rd party application developers?\nManagement of context informat
 ion at the Edge.\nHow can OpenStack be utilized to deploy various network 
 components to support the network exposure of APIs?\nHow real-time analyti
 cs data at the Edge can optimize the distributed infrastructure management
  with OpenStack\, Kubernetes etc.?\nCagatay Buyukkoc\, Lead RAN Architect\

DESCRIPTION:China Unicom\, a world leading telco\, has deployed one of the
  first edge-cloud solution in Tianjin (China). Its edge-cloud infrastructu
 re with low-latency and high performance network is a proven architecture 
 for telco&rsquo\;s 5G network transformation. In this solution\, China Uni
 com demonstrated a full-stack integrated architecture from data center inf
 rastructure\, resource management\, orchestration to edge applications. Th
 ese includes VR interactive video\, broadcasting\, Edge CDN\, AI-based sec
 urity monitoring\, and MEC-based (Multi-Access Edge Computing) multi-angle
  live video and broadcaster interaction service with Mercedes-Benz.\n In t
 his session\, we will share our experience in edge-cloud deployment. We wi
 ll present the OpenStack-based edge-cloud architecture\, its hardware conf
 iguration\, applications and the MEC design. We will also discuss the gaps
  of OpenStack for edge use cases and the needs for hardware accelerator de
 vices (e.g. FPGA\, GPU) as well as NFV requirements.

DESCRIPTION:In textile industry\, fabric defect relies on human inspection
  traditionally\, which is inaccurate\, inconsistent\, inefficient and expe
 nsive. There were automatic systems developed on the defect detection by i
 dentifying the faults in fabric surface using the image and video processi
 ng techniques. However\, the existing solution has insufficiencies in defe
 ct data sharing\, backhaul interconnect\, maintenance and etc. By evolving
  to an edge-optimized architecture\, we can help textile industry improve 
 fabric quality\, reduce operation cost and increase production efficiency.
  In this session\, I’ll share:\nWhat’s edge computing and why it’s i
 mportant to intelligence manufacturing\nWhat’s the characteristics\, str
 engths and weaknesses of traditional fabric defect detection method\nWhy t
 extile industry can benefit from edge computing infrastructure\nHow to des
 ign and implement an edge-enabled application for fabric defect detection 
 in real-time\nInsights\, synergy and future research directions\n

DESCRIPTION:Within US Public Sector\, the need for tactical field kits is 
 abundent. This applies to disaster response\, cyber response\, remote comp
 uting locations\, etc. The field kits need to be rugged\, portable\, and f
 ully capable to run all the applications and tools that run back in the ce
 ntral data center. While I focus on Public Sector customers this same set 
 of use cases applies to commercial entities as well.\nDuring this presenta
 tion\, I will demonstrate a cloudlet that our team has been utilizing to s
 olve the same prolems as our customers. Repeatable infrastructure in a sma
 ll form factor that can run the same workloads that will run in our custom
 ers data centers. We often have limited network connectivity and need a co
 mpletely isolated environment to demonstrate our open source software stac
 k.\nWe are working with many customers to help translate what we've done f
 or our own solutation architects in the field to solve their field kit nee
 ds.\n

DESCRIPTION:Openstack Microclouds is a project that aims to reduce the ent
 ry costs and simplify the process of transitioning to cloud technologies o
 f new clients\, by sharing geo-distributed controller nodes among multiple
  deployments. By leaving only the networking and compute functions to the 
 client\, we make the process of setting up a public cloud with highly avai
 lable controller nodes a simple task. Using technologies like Ansible and 
 Docker we are able to present each client with an isolated and independent
  OpenStack deployment\, making management of multiple deployments almost a
  trivial job.
