DESCRIPTION:In textile industry\, fabric defect relies on human inspection
  traditionally\, which is inaccurate\, inconsistent\, inefficient and expe
 nsive. There were automatic systems developed on the defect detection by i
 dentifying the faults in fabric surface using the image and video processi
 ng techniques. However\, the existing solution has insufficiencies in defe
 ct data sharing\, backhaul interconnect\, maintenance and etc. By evolving
  to an edge-optimized architecture\, we can help textile industry improve 
 fabric quality\, reduce operation cost and increase production efficiency.
  In this session\, I’ll share:\nWhat’s edge computing and why it’s i
 mportant to intelligence manufacturing\nWhat’s the characteristics\, str
 engths and weaknesses of traditional fabric defect detection method\nWhy t
 extile industry can benefit from edge computing infrastructure \nHow to de
 sign and implement an edge-enabled application for fabric defect detection
  in real-time\nInsights\, synergy and future research directions\n

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack's Virtualized Guests require the same security featu
 res as their physical counterparts. Intel's Trusted Execution Technology (
 TXT)along with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) provides a security anchor 
 for physical hosts by taking secure measurements of software and platformc
 omponents\, securing boot and interface keys\, as well as securing passwor
 ds.In this session\, we discuss and demo a secure approach at leveraging t
 he software-based virtual TPM\, in an OpenStack environment\, to provide t
 he same security capabilities to the much more dynamic cloud environment.

DESCRIPTION:Modern IoT analytics are computational and data intensive. Exi

 rom high latency\, network congestion\, and privacy issues. In this presen

  IOT device itself\, The IOT device will run docker containers managed by 
 kubernetes. The analysis done at IOT devices will be sent to applications 
 running on cloud managed by openstack.\nWe will present a small demo of de
 ploying a tensorflow application using kubernetes on IOT device\, an end t

DESCRIPTION:Telexistence is a fundamental concept named for the general te
 chnology that enables a human being to have a real-time sensation of being
  at a place other than where he or she actually exists\, and being able to
  interact with the remote environment\, which may be real\, virtual\, or a
  combination of both. It is an advanced and emerging technology in robotic
 s\, which combines Virtual Reality\, Remote Sensing\, Real-time Communicat
 ion\, Cloud Networking\, Machine Learning\, Humanoid Robots together. With
  the rapid development of telecommunication\, especially 5G\, edge computi
 ng\, IOT infrastructure\, telexistence is becoming realistic and producibl
 e\, rather than cinematic concept or research topic.\nAs a startup company
  in telexistence\, we would love to share our knowledge and ideas about ho
 w to build a large-scale and distributed cloud networking control plane de
 dicated to telexistence in days. The most important point is that this SDN
  architecture is fully powered by OpenStack.

 a deep evaluation of the communicationlayer of OpenStack in massively dist
 ributed environments. This includes anevaluation of different messaging te

DESCRIPTION:With the emerge of 5G services\, Telco Operators face fierce r
 equirement for building large number of edge clouds to support the low-lat
 ency distributed services\, including MEC & CRAN. In this talk\, we would 
 like to share the future network framework nationwide in China Mobile\, an

 eatures its future network with multiple DC specifically designed for telc

 e stations. We can hardly call them as DC or clouds. The unique features o
 f edge TIC raise requirement for light weight OpenStack\, unified accelera

DESCRIPTION:It is projected that there will be billions of connected devic
 es and trillions of digitized entities in the years ahead. Increasingly ou
 r everyday devices are being empowered with more processing\, memory\, sto
 rage and input/output capacities. The size of the data getting generated b
 y these devices are humongous whereas the scope\, speed\, and structure of
  data are varying. Our environments are being stuffed with multifaceted se
 nsors\, actuators and devices. The challenge is to aggregate all the prope
 rty and people data to do localized and cognitive analytics to extricate a
 nd disseminate actionable insights in time to produce smarter devices and 
 people-centric services. The traditional cloud environments are massive in
  their processing and storage capabilities but the real-time data capture\
 , analytics\, decision-making and actuation are hard. The strategic altern
 ative is to form edge device clouds for instantaneous data capture\, clean
 sing and crunching of sensor and actuator data

DESCRIPTION:Cloud Edge computing use cases range from IoT to VR/AR and any
  widely distributed application in between.  However\, taking OpenStack ou
 t of the data center requires an entirely new approach to security when th
 ere is far less ability to restrict access and often the applications requ
 ire a shared tenant model. Some of the factors that need to be considered 
 include:\n\nMore stringent requirements for infrastructure software (code/
 design) in exposed environments\nNew ways of thinking about RBAC at the co
 ntrol interfaces\nConflicts arising from shared ownership and divided resp
 onsibilities for devices/systems/applications\nManaging lifecycle operatio
 ns and deployments over insecure WAN connections\nDifferent ways of lookin

 emory separation from the underlying virtualization/hardware components\nM
 anaging security over intermittent WAN connections\nSecuring semi-autonomo

DESCRIPTION:The advent of 5G will change the communications industry by en

 edge of the network. Additionally\, 5G will allow deployment of both virtu

 eby opening a way to expose many of these mobile services capabilities thr
 ough APIs. \nThese APIs will be used by the 3rd party applications such as
  AR/VR\, IoT\, media etc. It is expected that the exposure of network APIs
  at the Edge will drive further innovation.\nIn this presentation\, we wil

DESCRIPTION:With the usage of edge clouds\, it will be possible to run ban

 vings.The cloud will evolve into a distributed network of clouds which are
  connected to each other and holistically managed. Applications can be acc

DESCRIPTION:Edge clouds are here. But what is typically missed out in curr
 ent discussions is that data center networking doesn&rsquo\;t mix well wit
 h WAN infrastructure. Having these networks understand and talk to each ot
 her while eliminating gateways will reduce network infrastructure footprin
 t in edge sites.\nWe will discuss common issues and how utilizing the Neut
 ron's BGP-VPN API lets us address this and\, in the process\, make your ed
 ge cloud network be an extension of a wider VPN without any special overla
 ys or network stitching. Additionally\, it can request and receive guarant
 ees in terms of bandwidth or latency as needed. All these are achieved not
  with investments in extra network equipment\, but by merging the traditio
 nal CE/PE roles and providing higher port utilization and high throughput.
  Finally\, we will also discuss how BGPVPN API's need to adapted for emerg

 time overlapping scope. Openstack is one of them. The variety of architect
 ures result in a variety of options.\nAutoscaling is a good example of suc
 h automation. Some of this logic will be built into the application layer 
 possibly by a specialized microservice. But some of it can be built at the
  network layer in some Master orchestrator such as ONAP. Still some may al

DESCRIPTION:Openstack Microclouds is a project that aims to reduce the ent
 ry costs and simplify the process of transitioning to cloud technologies o
 f new clients\, by sharing geo-distributed controller nodes among multiple
  deployments. By leaving only the networking and compute functions to the 
 client\, we make the process of setting up a public cloud with highly avai
 lable controller nodes a simple task. Using technologies like Ansible and 
 Docker we are able to present each client with an isolated and independent
  OpenStack deployment\, making management of multiple deployments almost a
  trivial job.
