DESCRIPTION:Integration as a first-class citizen is important for end-user
 s\, application developers\, and operators as well as B2B and B2C relation
 ships. No one system or project by itself successfully addresses a use cas
 e\; even 1s need 0s. One integration that has been identified is OpenStack
  and Kubernetes. Working to test and improve support for the most popular 
 OpenStack Software Development Kits (SDKs)—as well as platforms like Kub
 ernetes\, Terraform\, and Cloud Foundry we have been working to strengthen
  two of the key components to this integration\; Gophercloud and Terraform
  (OpenStack provider). We will discuss what we have done\, why we have don
 e it\, what we plan to do next as it relates to this integration\, and a d

DESCRIPTION:Deploying Kubernetes with Terraform on an OpenStack cloud will
  ultimately lead to the question what to do about load balancing. Both the
  Kubernetes API and services need to be load balanced. With its reliabilit
 y and scalability OpenStack Octavia becomes a natural choice for such a de
 ployment and this talk will explore the architecture\, the necessary enhan
 cements to Terraform and K8\, and general setup of such a solution.

DESCRIPTION:This course provides a detailed examination of container archi
 tecture from the Linux kernel to Kubernetes\, including security & resourc
 e controls\, kernel structures\, and low level storage & network function.
  This lab provides hands-on training\, concepts\, and demonstrations\, wit
 h an emphasis on realistic deployment and troubleshooting exercises.\nTopi
 cs include security (sVirt\, SELinux\, SECCOMP)\, isolation (kernel namesp
 aces\, cgroups)\, and data structures (Kubernetes/Linux). Together\, these
  topics provide an architectural level understanding of the complete conta
 iner stack\, from the Linux kernel\, to container runtime (Docker\,CRI-O\,
  runc)\, and container orchestration (Kubernetes).\nFollowing a logical pa
 th from container host & image\, to container runtime\, to orchestrator\, 
 we will answer questions like: How does sVirt/SELinux\, SECCOMP\, namespac
 es\, and isolation really work? How does the Docker Daemon work? How does 
 Kubernetes talk to the Docker Daemon? How are container images made?\n

DESCRIPTION:Delegation allows a user to let someone or something else perf
 orm operations on her behalf.  Delegation is the the key to scaling.    In
  order to delegate\, you have to make use of the access control mechanisms
  of your automation.Both Keystone and Kubernetes have Role Based Access Co
 ntrol (RBAC).  While there is\, as of yet\, no interoperability between th
 em.  There is also no attempt to support the applications running on top o
 f them.  In this presentation\, we'll go through the RBAC mechanisms of bo
 th layers\, and then discuss how to extend a unified view of RBAC to the e
 nd user facing applications.  Making use of basic Open Source technologies
  for Ansible Management\, LDAP and Web Single Sign On\, as well as unified
  API management\, find out how to make a sane strategy for managing your c

DESCRIPTION:Using public cloud resources to cover for peak workloads is a 
 practical and economical alternative to over provisioning on-premise resou
 rces. This is the case in environments like CERN where its large internal 
 computing infrastructure is usually big enough but where periods prior to 
 big international conferences or large event reconstruction campaigns see 
 a significant spike in the amount of workloads submitted.\nWe describe ear
 ly experiences relying on Kubernetes federations deployed and managed by O
 penStack Magnum to expand the available capacity to external clouds\, whil
 e still offering a single entrypoint to our users - using GKE\, AKS\, Amaz
 on and other clouds. We will cover the internals of the federation integra
 tion in Magnum\, and some of the issues we had (mainly networking) and how
  we solved them. We will present how these deployments simplify the integr
 ation with our main batch system\, and how workloads running on external r
 esources access their corresponding datasets.

DESCRIPTION:Wouldn’t it be cool if there was a way to have 3rd party ven
 dor drivers to have a way to build their own Kolla based containers? In th
 is talk\, we propose a framework where 3rd party vendor drivers are built 
 as a layer on top of Kolla’s core containers. This solution allows vendo
 rs to determine how their containers are built and managed while continuin
 g to stay out-of-tree. With this solution\, OpenStack operators can still 
 utilize the power of Kolla’s installer infrastructure to install these c
 ontainers and also integrate into its configuration framework. The solutio
 n does not involve using OpenStack CI to build these 3rd party container 
 images.\nIn this talk\, we will explain the best practices to containerize
  OpenStack vendor plugins and use vendor hardware or vendor NFV and use 3r
 d-party CI to gate them with OpenStack using Kolla and do a cool demo at t
 he end!\n Bring your hardware\, and we'll conainerize its plugins for Ope

DESCRIPTION:Since Dec 2017\, Hyper\, Intel\, and other contributors have b
 een working on the kata containers project under OpenStack Foundation. The
  goal of kata containers is to create a hypervisor-based OCI container run
 time based on the runV and clear containers project\, provide VM-level iso
 lation and container-like speed. \nDuring the kata containers and frakti p
 roject developing\, we noticed the Kata Containers could be a first-class 
 runtime of Kubernetes which is expected to co-work with namespace-based Li
 nux containers on the same host (regardless of physical server or VM) thro
 ugh CRI. The integration is about bringing isolation and hard multi-tenanc
 y to Kubernetes\, and also\, make it possible to run privileged workloads 
 in Linux containers at the same time.\nThe presentation will introduce how
  frakti version 2 becomes a unified multi-tenancy enabled kubernetes CRI r
 untime based on Kata Containers.

DESCRIPTION:Kata Containers is a new open source project merging two hyper
 visor-based container runtime efforts: Hyper's runV and Intel's Clear Cont
 ainers. Providing an OCI and CRI compatible runtime\, it is seamlessly int
 egrated with OpenStack containers services. Each container\, or each sandb
 ox as defined by Zun\, is hypervisor-isolated and runs inside a dedicated 
 Linux VM. Combining Zun and Kata Containers provide OpenStack users with a
  much stronger isolation layer between all containerized workloads\, while
  being able to safely run bare metal containers.\nThis talk will walk thro
 ugh Kata&rsquo\;s unique architecture\, how it integrates with Openstack a
 nd other Cloud software stacks\, and focus around a few key points like ne
 tworking and storage. It will highlight the will for Kata Containers to be
 come a new standard to run virtualized containers\, and encourage people t

DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes make container easier to deploy\, manage and scale.
  However\, using Kubernetes on OpenStack still requires users to manage th
 e underlying infrastructure such as a cluster of virtual servers. Users ar
 e responsible for the initial capacity planning\, such as deciding the clu
 ster size\, as well as the maintenance of the running clusters.\nThe emerg
 ing of serverless container technologies or solutions such as Amazon Web S
 ervice (AWS) Fargate\, Azure Container Instance (ACI) and OpenStack Zun pr
 ovide a viable alternative to run containers on the cloud. The serverless 
 approach allows users to run containers without having to pre-create or ma
 nage their own clusters.\nIn this presentation\, we will talk about how we
  adopt the serverless approach. We will leverage Kubernetes as the orchest
 ration layer and make Kubernetes provision &ldquo\;serverless&rdquo\; cont
 ainers using OpenStack Zun. This approach allows us to use Kubernetes with
  zero server management.

DESCRIPTION:In container networking\, there is always a conflict between t
 he higher forwarding speed demand and the less resources(cores/threads/mem
 ory) to run the containers. To resolve this problem\, we introduced DPDK a
 s microservices to ZTE's container network. We used some features of dpdk 
 such as primary/secondary mode\, lockless ring\, sharing memory\, virtio_u
 ser\, vhost and so on\, to promote the performance. At the same time\, we 
 used a heartbeat-like mechanism to keep alive and a fail-safe mechanism to
  provide high availability. Our model achieved bidirectional zero-copy bet
 ween containers which brought us high performance at a cost of only one de
 dicated thread. This model could be used in 5G network slicing and other I
 CT areas.

 examine the idealized life cycle of a Magnum cluster\, from the initial RE
 ST call to the point where the user retrieves the access credentials for t
 he finished cluster. We will follow the cluster through Magnum and the Ope
 nStack components involved in building it as it takes shape and examine th

 n the second part we will provide troubleshooting advice on various parts 
 of the cluster creation process that commonly fail. This part will cover b

 how an example of a VNF implementation based on VMs and containers. Variou
 s solutions have been proposed for this challenge. Some solutions use Magn
 um\, Kuryr\, Fuxi\, or Zun to solve management and networking issues\, but
  create strong linkage to OS. Others manage containers at VM level\, so OS
  commands can be used\, not K8S commands. Fully isolated environments coul
 d use one OS platform for cloud native\, container only platforms and anot
 her for VMs\, connecting them by a VNF with both containers and VMs\, or w
 ith an SDN controller for the networking part. Our option allows VNFs to b
 e developed for hybrid environments\, where installation is based on OS an
 d networking uses Calico BGP to distribute Neutron networks to container d
 omain.We address lifecycle management\, including installation\, managemen

 used to deploy and manage resilient microservices\, but it can be challeng
 ing to navigate them all from first principles.  In this talk\, members o
 f the OpenStack-Helm team will help get you to a stateless containerized a
 rchitecture faster by sharing some of the technical approaches and best pr
 actices in use by the project today.\nThese reusable techniques\, tooling\
 , and conventions enable OpenStack-Helm to solve for flexible orchestratio
 n of complex systems of containerized services.  Real-world examples will
  be discussed\, and Q&A is encouraged.\nThis presentation also serves as a
 n introduction into what makes OpenStack-Helm tick\, for those interested 
 in leveraging or contributing to the project.

DESCRIPTION:Application containerization is one of the coolest technologie
 s in IT. It solves numerous problems\, allows for incredible application d
 ensity\, and can really increase flexibility and responsiveness. But not e
 veryone understands what makes up container security - it's a LOT more tha
 n what application is in the container.\nIn this session\, Red Hat&rsquo\;
 s Thomas Cameron\, will talk about the basic components of container secur
 ity. He'll talk about kernel namespaces\, Security Enhanced Linux\, Linux 
 control groups\, the Docker daemon\, etc. and how they all work. He'll pro
 vide demonstrations of how each of these technologies affect security.\nHe
 'll also talk about tips and tricks for planning a secure container enviro
 nment\, describe some &ldquo\;gotchas&rdquo\; about containers\, and debun
 k some of the security myths about containers.\nAttendees will understand 
 the fundamentals of container security when they leave.

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180523T213000Z
UID:21134@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:In the Container world\, there is a need to build observabilit
 y around apps and backing services running in containers.\nThe observabili
 ty should allow to capture on demand low level metrics at a low overhead.\
 nThe proposal is to use ebpf as the tracing technology to capture details 
 at kernel & user level\, and generate on demand flamegraphs\, heat maps fo
 r applications & backing services.\nThe Linux kernel has a built-in BPF JI
 T compiler\, and an in-kernel verifier which is used to validate eBPF prog
 rams. This allows user defined instrumentation on a live kernel image that
  can never crash\, hang or interfere with the kernel negatively. eBPF prov
 ides in-kernel implementation of storage maps such as histograms and hash-
 maps\, which helps in efficient copy of summarized monitoring data from ke
 rnel to user space with low overhead.\nThese features make eBPF programs s
 afe to run in production and allow admins and engineers to collect crucial
  data from systems for performance analysis and monitoring.

 sage caused confusion for users deploying containerized applications and w
 as difficult for storage vendors to engineer support for all. To resolve t

DESCRIPTION:Network Functionality Virtualization is gaining huge traction 
 in telco industry as it offers faster service enablement and cost savings 
 in deploying Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Telco providers have to mee
 t service availability at 99.999% (Carrier-grade). Most of the VNFs are pa
 ckaged and run on virtual machines. However containers with Kubernetes as 
 orchestration engine is becoming more popular because of increased agility
 \, reduced footprint and auto-scaling capabilities.\nThough containers has
  become a viable alternative to virtual machines\, there are significant g
 aps to meet carrier grade requirements for network functions in containers
 .  This talk presents how to operate Kubernetes on OpenStack and provide
  the following key capabilities:\nMulti-tenancy with resource guarantees\n
 Multiple network interfaces which is a basic need for functions such as fi
 rewall\nData acceleration to give high throughput and low latency\nEnhance

 odes it can use varied virtual devices such as SR-IOV and VLAN.\nKuryr has
  a generic Kubernetes controller that allows watching different Kubernetes
  resources and perform actions in response to their events. It can support
  multiple networking backends. Kuryr default implementation is based on Op
 enStack Neutron\, it can be easily extended to serve other SDNs.\nIn this 
 talk we will dive into Kuryr-Kubernetes CNI\, explaining its architecture.
  In addition we will show with the Dragonflow example that Kuryr provides 
 a generic SDN framework for different networking backends by implementing 
 some pluggable Python modules.
