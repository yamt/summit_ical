DESCRIPTION:OpenStack Upstream Institute is an intensive program designed 
 to share knowledge about the different ways of contributing to OpenStack l
 ike providing new features\, writing documentation\, participating in work
 ing groups\, and so forth. The educational program is built on the princip
 le of open collaboration and will teach the students how to find informati
 on and navigate the intricacies of the project’s technical tools and soc
 ial interactions in order to get the contributions accepted. The live one 
 and a half day class is focusing on hands-on practice like the students ca
 n use a development environment to work on real-life bug fixes or new feat
 ures and learn how to test\, prepare and upload them for review. The atten
 dees are also given the opportunity to join a mentoring program to get fur
 ther help and guidance on their journey to become an active and successful
  member of the OpenStack community.\nPlease note that OpenStack Upstream I

DESCRIPTION:In Sydney the OpenStack Foundation announced a new integration
  strategy to support open infrastructure more generally. It later resulted
  in the definition of several strategic focus areas\, and the Foundation l
 aunching its first non-OpenStack project\, Kata Containers.\nHow did we ar
 rive there ? What are the consequences for the OpenStack Foundation\, and 
 for the OpenStack open source project ? What progress have we been making 
 over the last 6 months ? Where are we going next ? In this talk\, Thierry 
 Carrez\, VP of Engineering for the OpenStack Foundation\, will share the s
 tory behind that critical evolution and detail the challenges ahead of us.

DESCRIPTION:If you're new to OpenStack or in want of some mentoring\, this
  session is a great icebreaker and a way to get know new and experienced p
 eople in the OpenStack community. We plan to divide the session between ca
 reer\, technical and community mentoring. Mentees will be organized into s
 mall groups and each group will have several 15 minute mentoring sessions.
  In your small group\, you'll get to know a bit about a mentor and have an
  opportunity to ask them a question or two about how you can grow your car
 eer\, get involved in the community\, and make the most of the summit. The
 n\, at the end of 15 minutes\, a new mentor will cycle to your group and t
 he process will repeat.

 made still talk to you after years away from the Mothership? This\, and mo

DESCRIPTION:Open source is fueled by the continual influx of new contribut
 ors who offer fresh talent and diverse perspectives. Mentoring programs an
 d activities\, like the Google Summer of Code (GSoC)\, Outreachy\, Upstrea
 m Institute\, First Contact SIG\, Long-term Mentoring and Speed Mentoring\
 , are critical in inspiring this next generation of contributors\, yet eac
 h also brings its own challenges. This interactive panel discussion will e
 xplore multiple mentor programs through which new contributors enter the O
 penStack community\, tracking contributions from participants along their 
 paths and examining their retention once their program participation ends.
  Learn about several of the mentor initiatives across multiple OpenStack p
 rojects\, and how they are working to attract and retain contributors. And
  explore the pros and cons of a small group &ldquo\;cohort&rdquo\; mentor 
 model over 1x1 mentor interaction as we pinpoint what works most effective
 ly for our OpenStack community.

DESCRIPTION:As a wheelchair user\, i'm still somewhat "special"\, expecial
 ly when it comes to work as a freelancer or consultant working for multipl
 e companies\, no matter how big they are.\nOver the last 15 years\, i expe
 rienced a lot of thrilling moments when the wheelchair starts to play a ro
 le. And the same happens when it comes to community events.\nSince HongKon
 g Summit\, back in 2013\, i attended all the summits all around the world.
  Additionally i also visited a lot of other community events and even host
 ed meetups for OpenSource Projects. And each and every of those events had
  at least a small "issue".\nThe OpenStack Foundation did a lot of improvem
 ents over the last summits and they really care. Same goes for most of the
  events (i guess)\, but i would like to give you a few hints\, tipps\, exp
 eriences to make inclusion easier.\nLets see how we can make events\, work
 \, just say the world\, easy accessible for each and everyone\, so that we
  don't need to care\, it just works.

SUMMARY:Git and Gerrit Lunch and Learn

UID:20783@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:OpenStack software development is centered around the Git and 
 Gerrit systems to promote the aspect of community programming.\nGit is an 
 open source version control system that allows many software developers to
  work on a given project without requiring them to chare a common network.
 \nGerrit is a free\, web-based team code collaboration tool which integrat
 es closely with Git and allows developers in a team to review each other's
  modifications to the source code using a web browser to approve or reject
  those changes.\nIn this session we will walk participants through opening
  a bug in a test system and then submit a patch to a repository in OpenSta
 c k. The process involves learning about Git using the most common command
 s and progressing through the review process in Gerrit. Participants will 
 walk away with a working knowledge of these tools.

DESCRIPTION:In a community as large as ours\, there are a lot of different
  types of workers. There are those who go into the office everyday\, there
  are those with long commutes\, and there are those who work remotely. Reg
 ardless of your workspace\, if you are an OpenStack contributor\, you are 
 also a remote worker. \nBeing a remote worker can be an intensely lonely e
 xperience if you aren&rsquo\;t connected with the people you work with. Of
 tentimes\, you work more closely with people who do not work for the same 
 company that you do. With the increase of remote workers\, community healt
 h and these relationships are even more important to the community at larg

DESCRIPTION:While the number of public and private cloud deployments is ra
 pidly growing the transition towards cloud-native applications is still in
  progress. It is crucial to provide support for different kinds of workloa
 ds by adding functionality even if it is considered somewhat old-fashioned
 .Development of the volume multi-attach feature started in 2014 and the fi
 rst version was released in Queens. We will guide you through the journey 
 of the development process and beyond the history lesson will highlight th
 e use cases behind the high demand from users and vendors alike.You will l
 earn about the functionality including the API design\, caveats and effort
 s put into the CI testing with Tempest and Zuulv3 and plans for improvemen
 ts. This talk will be valuable for operators\, users\, and contributors an
 d give a glimpse into the work of a complicated cross-project change devel
 oped by numerous contributors from different vendors.

SUMMARY:What we learned from Metrics as Community Managers
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180524T234000Z
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180525T002000Z
UID:20823@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Many open source projects use metrics to inspect community par
 ticipation by looking into the numbers of different forms of contributions
  and overall ecosystem support by following user adoption and event statis
 tics. On longer term\, these metrics are also used to get a view on commun
 ity health\, growth and overall dynamics. While these numbers can encourag
 e participation and transparency\, they can often be misleading if used wi
 thout context and/or more in-depth analysis and could even lead to unhealt
 hy behaviors.  In this session\, Ildiko and Ray will discuss how metrics a
 re used in communities such as OpenStack and OPNFV and share their learnin
 gs from community metrics initiatives.  \n
