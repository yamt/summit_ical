DESCRIPTION:Airship is a collection of interoperable and loosely coupled o
 pen source tools that provide for automated cloud provisioning and life cy
 cle management in a completely declarative and predictable way. The focus 
 of this project is the implementation of a declarative platform to introdu
 ce OpenStack on Kubernetes\, and the lifecycle management of the resulting
  cloud. Airship achieves this by managing the lifecycle of the entire stac
 k\, from the baremetal infrastructure and network configuration\, to the D
 ocker configuration and Kubernetes cluster\, as well as OpenStack. It does
  this with the scale\, speed\, resiliency\, flexibility and operational pr
 edictability demanded of Network Clouds at scale.\nThis presentation provi
 des an overview of the Airship project and its recent transition to the Op
 enStack foundation. You can expect to learn what services and components m
 ake up the Airship project as well as how they work together to provide de
 clarative and predictable lifecycle management for your cloud and the adva
 ntages this brings for operators. We will review how this is leveraged tod
 ay by several companies and how you can get started using and contributing
  to the project.\nAt its core\, the Airship project has four main objectiv
 es:\nBE DECLARATIVE Sites are declared using YAML. This includes both hard
  assets such as network configuration and bare metal hosts as well as soft
  assets like helm charts\, their overrides\, and container images. You man
 age the document and Airship implements it.\nONE WORKFLOW FOR LIFE CYCLE M
 ANAGEMENT We needed a system that was predictable with life cycle manageme
 nt at its core. This meant ensuring we had one workflow that handled both 
 initial deployments as well as future site updates. In other words\, there
  should be virtually nothing different when interacting with a new deploym
 ent or providing an an update to an existing site.\nCONTAINERS AS THE NEW 
 UNIT OF SOFTWARE DELIVERY Containers are the unit of software delivery for
  Airship. Everything is a container. This allows us to predictably promote
  hermetically sealed containers from development\, to testing\, and finall
 y production with confidence.\nFLEXIBLE FOR DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES AND SO
 FTWARE Airship is delivering environments both very small and large with a
  wide range of configurations. We use Airship to manage our entire cloud p
 latform\, not just OpenStack.

DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes and Helm allow for near-effortless deployment and m
 anagement of resilient resources.  This talk will discuss bringing simila
 r ease to test automation in a container-orchestrated context.\nOpenStack-
 Helm (OSH) is a Helm chart library that allows simple customization and de
 ployment of OpenStack containers across k8s clusters\, from laptop-scale t
 o data center-scale.  As OSH matures\, it integrates robust and seamless 
 testing via Tempest and Rally functionality.  OSH leverages these tools i
 n multiple contexts\, from lightweight "helm test" validation to full-blow
 n Helm charts with customizable container overrides.\nThis talk will provi
 de an overview of the OSH QA integration as currently implemented\, as wel
 l as our vision for containerized testing efforts in the future. We hope i
 t will serve as an informative talk as well as a collaboration point betwe
 en others in the community to ultimately make containerized testing effort
 s as functional/robust/useful as possible.

DESCRIPTION:Delegation allows a user to let someone or something else perf
 orm operations on her behalf.  Delegation is the the key to scaling.    In
  order to delegate\, you have to make use of the access control mechanisms
  of your automation.Both Keystone and Kubernetes have Role Based Access Co
 ntrol (RBAC).  While there is\, as of yet\, no interoperability between th
 em.  There is also no attempt to support the applications running on top o
 f them.  In this presentation\, we'll go through the RBAC mechanisms of bo
 th layers\, and then discuss how to extend a unified view of RBAC to the e

DESCRIPTION:Containers provide a compelling alternative virtualization for
  modern application development. OpenShift running on OpenStack allows com
 bining the exposition of resources in the infrastructure layer such as net
 work\, compute and storage\, provided by OpenStack\, with in the consumpti
 on of these resources from the platform side by OpenShift. One of the many
  benefits of running OpenShift on OpenStack is the ability to deploy conta
 iners on bare metal using OpenStack Ironic. Different applications have va
 rying performance requirements\, many of them benefiting from running on b
 are metal. The density of containers per node and the scalability of bare 
 metal nodes hosting containers can be orchestrated by OpenShift and OpenSt
 ack Bare Metal. In this session you will learn how OpenShift Container Pla
 tform is used with Red Hat OpenStack Platform and its Bare Metal service\,
  maximizing container performance and application scalability in the priva
 te cloud.

 penStack Magnum to expand the available capacity to external clouds\, whil
 e still offering a single entrypoint to our users - using GKE\, AKS\, Amaz
 on and other clouds. We will cover the internals of the federation integra
 tion in Magnum\, and some of the issues we had (mainly networking) and how
  we solved them. We will present how these deployments simplify the integr

DESCRIPTION:Wouldn’t it be cool if there was a way to have 3rd party ven
 dor drivers to have a way to build their own Kolla based containers? In th
 is talk\, we propose a framework where 3rd party vendor drivers are built 
 as a layer on top of Kolla’s core containers. This solution allows vendo
 rs to determine how their containers are built and managed while continuin
 g to stay out-of-tree. With this solution\, OpenStack operators can still 
 utilize the power of Kolla’s installer infrastructure to install these c
 ontainers and also integrate into its configuration framework. The solutio
 n does not involve using OpenStack CI to build these 3rd party container 
 images.\nIn this talk\, we will explain the best practices to containerize
  OpenStack vendor plugins and use vendor hardware or vendor NFV and use 3r
 d-party CI to gate them with OpenStack using Kolla and do a cool demo at t
 he end!\n Bring your hardware\, and we'll conainerize its plugins for Ope

DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes make container easier to deploy\, manage and scale.
  However\, using Kubernetes on OpenStack still requires users to manage th
 e underlying infrastructure such as a cluster of virtual servers. Users ar

 ster size\, as well as the maintenance of the running clusters.\nThe emerg
 ing of serverless container technologies or solutions such as Amazon Web S
 ervice (AWS) Fargate\, Azure Container Instance (ACI) and OpenStack Zun pr
 ovide a viable alternative to run containers on the cloud. The serverless 
 approach allows users to run containers without having to pre-create or ma
 nage their own clusters.\nIn this presentation\, we will talk about how we
  adopt the serverless approach. We will leverage Kubernetes as the orchest
 ration layer and make Kubernetes provision &ldquo\;serverless&rdquo\; cont
 ainers using OpenStack Zun. This approach allows us to use Kubernetes with

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack is currently the best available option for building 
 private clouds\, with the ability to manage networking\, storage and compu
 te infrastructure\, with support for virtual machines\, bare-metal\, and c
 ontainers from one control plane. While Kubernetes is arguably the most po
 pular container orchestrator and has changed application delivery\, it dep
 ends on the availability of a solid cloud infrastructure\, and OpenStack o
 ffers the most comprehensive open source infrastructure for hosting applic
 ations. OpenStack’s multi-tenant cloud infrastructure is a natural fit f
 or Kubernetes\, with several integration points\, deployment solutions\, a
 nd ability to federate across multiple clouds.In this talk\, we’re going
  to explore how containers work within OpenStack\, examine various use cas
 es\, and provide an overview of open source projects\, from OpenStack and 
 elsewhere\, that help make containers a technology that’s easily adopted
  and utilized.

DESCRIPTION:MetalK8s is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution with a focu

 ko solution in customer datacenters.It is based on the Kubespray project t
 o reliably install a base Kubernetes cluster\, including all dependencies 
 (like etcd)\, using the Ansible provisioning tool. This installation is fu
 rther augmented with operational tools for monitoring and metering\, inclu
 ding Prometheus\, Grafana\, ElasticSearch and Kibana. Furthermore\, an "in
 gress controller" is deployed by default\, based on Nginx. All of these ar
 e managed as Helm packages.Unlike hosted Kubernetes solutions\, where netw
 ork-attached storage is available and managed by the provider\, we assume 
 no such system to be available in environments where MetalK8s is deployed.
  As such\, we focus on managing node-local storage\, and exposing these vo

DESCRIPTION:The Magnum service brings container orchestration to OpenStack
 \, allowing OpenStack users to get a turnkey Kubernetes\, Mesos or Docker 
 Swarm cluster set up and ready to host containers with a simple REST call 
 to the Magnum API. At least that would be the case in an ideal world. In o
 ur world\, the key does not always turn. And if it does\, the (Heat) engin
 e driving Magnum may sputter and die. In the first part\, we will closely 
 examine the idealized life cycle of a Magnum cluster\, from the initial RE
 ST call to the point where the user retrieves the access credentials for t
 he finished cluster. We will follow the cluster through Magnum and the Ope
 nStack components involved in building it as it takes shape and examine th
 e roles the individual services play in creating the cluster bit by bit. I
 n the second part we will provide troubleshooting advice on various parts 
 of the cluster creation process that commonly fail. This part will cover b

 how an example of a VNF implementation based on VMs and containers. Variou
 s solutions have been proposed for this challenge. Some solutions use Mag
 num\, Kuryr\, Fuxi\, or Zun to solve management and networking issues\, bu
 t create strong linkage to OS. Others manage containers at VM level\, so 
 OS commands can be used\, not K8S commands. Fully isolated environments c
 ould use one OS platform for cloud native\, container only platforms and a
 nother for VMs\, connecting them by a VNF with both containers and VMs\, o
 r with an SDN controller for the networking part. Our option allows VNFs 
 to be developed for hybrid environments\, where installation is based on O
 S and networking uses Calico BGP to distribute Neutron networks to contain
 er domain.We address lifecycle management\, including installation\, manag
 ement\, networking and root cause analysis in the hybrid world.

 maintain\, and upgrade from version to version.\n \nOur solution is to uti
 lise Fission\,  an open source\, serverless framework built on Kubernetes!
  We have built a Heat module for Fission that will give you the ability to
  use your favorite programing/scripting language (Python\, NodeJS\, Go\, C
 #\, Bash\, etc&hellip\;) to write a simple function\, and Heat will be abl
 e to execute that function and return it&rsquo\;s result.\n \nHere are thr
 ee examples of the most common use cases. First\, creation of Active Direc
 tory Users and Groups. Second\, enabling updates of CMDB or DNS records. T
 hird\, building a self-service catalog using Murano Apps to provision Anyt
 hing as a Service (XaaS).

DESCRIPTION:Currently in a datacenter everyone has containers managed by K
 ubernetes and also Openstack as a IAAS platform . we need a unified way to
  making sure that these kinda of hybrid setup can works on same network . 
 Project Calico help us to bridge that gap . Calico provides a pure L3 fab
 ric solution for interconnecting Virtual Machines or Linux Containers (“
 workloads”). Instead of a vSwitch\, Calico employs a vRouter function in
  each compute node.From Kubernetes to OpenStack\, AWS to GCE\, Calico sup
 ports all of major cloud providers.\nBefore coming to the session\, Please
  download the VirtualBox image from the following URL\, the File size is a
 ppx 3.2 GB. URL:- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RWldBP_iJnyVVqTu

DESCRIPTION:SUSE Cloud Foundry (SCF) is an open source project (https://gi
 thub.com/SUSE/scf) to create a containerized distribution of Cloud Foundry
  that is deployed on Kubernetes using Helm. In this talk we will discuss t
 he architecture design for containerization (going beyond making container
 s\, making it Kubernetes aware) and present our efforts to measure perform
 ance metrics for SCF. We will compare a "Kubernetes-native" Cloud Foundry 
 against a "traditional" BOSH OpenStack VM-based installation. The presente
 r will show the techniques used in these experiments and discuss the compa
 rison between the two styles of deploying Cloud Foundry. This talk is aime
 d at operators\, end-users and developers.

DESCRIPTION:In this lab I will show a practical way to use heavy software 
 (like OpenStack) or annoying software (like Cisco AnyConnect) via containe
 r technologies on insufficient or precious resources - for testing and pre
 paring customer environments - or just because we can :-) We will start wi
 th preparing our laptops and then creating a sufficient RHEL image to put 
 some workloads on it like the AnyConnect and RHOSP-Director to see possibi
 lities and limits of this approach. This lab is not for deploying producti
 on environments - it's more about embedding software that's normally runni
 ng in VMs on your weak Linux Laptop for testing things out. As an example 
 we use OpenStack - if you know how this one works\, everything else is a b
 reeze!

DESCRIPTION:Application service mesh frameworks provide many capabilities 
 across all application services in the mesh.  Service level capabilities l
 ike traffic management\, tracing/observability\, policy\, and security imp
 lemented by a common framework are valuable tools for application develope
 rs and administrators.  The Istio community provides tooling for creating 
 service meshes made up of services implemented in containers and/or VMs/ba
 remetal.  This talk will go through an example Istio on Openstack deployme
 nt with services in containers and VM/baremetal instances.  Tim and Arvind
  will describe Openstack features specifically leveraged by the Istio serv
 ice mesh\, including walking through sample Openstack and Istio deployment
  configuration.  Various Istio features will be discussed with the focus o
 n tie in with Openstack capabilities.\n
