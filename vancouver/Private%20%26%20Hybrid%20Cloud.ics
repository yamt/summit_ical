DESCRIPTION:Networking a Bare Metal cloud (using Ironic server deployments
 ) is more than just slapping VLANs on switch ports. If you need scale\, yo
 u need VXLAN &ndash\; even for bare metal cloud. \n \nHow does this mesh w
 ith pure software-based VXLAN deployments?\n \nThe latest SDN revolution i
 s centered on creating efficient virtualized data center networks using VX
 LAN & EVPN.  We will talk about the scale\, performance\, and cost advanta
 ges of using a modern controller-free virtualized network built on 100 Gig
 abit Ethernet switches with hardware based VXLAN Routing.   \nWe will expl
 ore how to automate such a network in an OpenStack environment and take yo
 u through a real world use case of using OpenStack Network Node bridging b
 etween a bare metal cloud (EVPN) and a fully virtualized cloud environment
 s (orchestrated by Neutron).

DESCRIPTION:CERN\, the European Organization for Nuclear Research\, is run
 ning for several years a large OpenStack Cloud that helps thousands of sci
 entists to analyze the data from the LHC.\nIn 2012\, early in the design p
 hase of the CERN Cloud we decided to use Nova Cells to enable the infrastr
 ucture to scale to thousands of nodes. Now with more than 280K cores sprea
 d across 70 cells that are hosted in two data centres we were faced with t
 he challenge to migrate to Nova Cells V2 required in the Pike release.\nIn
  this presentation\, we will describe how Nova Cells allowed CERN to scale
  to thousands of nodes\, its advantages and how we mitigate the implementa
 tion issues of Nova Cells V1. Next\, we will cover how we upgraded Nova fr
 om Newton with Cells V1 to Pike with Cells V2. We will explain the steps t
 hat we followed and the issues that we faced during the upgrade. Finally\,
  we will report our experience with Cells V2 at scale\, its caveats and ho
 w we are mitigate them.

DESCRIPTION:In LINE we operate massive scale messaging service with 200+ m
 illion active users\, where fair share of the service components are being
  hosted on our 2 private OpenStack-based clouds that are currently in a 50
 .000+ cores scale range\, and growing rapidly.\nAs our cloud expanded into
  new regions\, in order to achieve better scalability\, we had established
  a CLOS type network underlay all the way from top level fabric routers to
  the hypervisor itself\, while keeping our cloud architecture fairly simpl
 e.\n In this new architecture\, the Hypervisor would exchange routes to it
 s VMs with ToR switches\, thus providing the VMs with the external L3 conn
 ectivity and completely isolating L2 traffic between instances\, on hyperv
 isor and cloud level. Neutron currently does not support such use-case\, s
 o we had implemented a custom plugin and agent to make it possible. \nIn t
 his session we will explain how we had implemented such solution in Neutro
 n.

DESCRIPTION:Ceph has historically been challenged by transactional workloa
 ds requiring Iow latencies in the sub 10ms range.  This has excluded Ceph
  RBD from a whole class of applications and limited its adoption in the en

DESCRIPTION:Multiple clouds are a must in today&rsquo\;s IT world to preve
 nt vendor lock-in\, provide redundancy\, a migration path\, and other bene
 fits.   Developer's and IT admins demand that applications\, and the micro
 -services that comprise them\, be capable of running in multiple environme
 nts.   A service mesh\, instantiated by Istio\, provides a new paradigm fo
 r connecting\, managing and securing microservices.   With services runnin
 g in multiple clouds\, service mesh has to be established across the cloud
 s.   In this presentation John and Tim will show how an application can be
  stretched between two disparate cloud environments--public cloud and an O
 penStack based cloud.   The demonstration will show how the service mesh i
 s stretched to fully enable service mesh features for all services and end
 points in both cloud environments.

DESCRIPTION:As a core component of Openstack\, a deployment of Neutron pla
 ys a critical role in determining the achieved latency and throughput of t
 he virtual network. Consequently\, the network performance of VMs' communi
 cation in an Openstack deployment directly depends on how Neutron is deplo
 yed.\nThis presentation looks deeper into DPDK as an enabler of faster pac
 ket processing in a Neutron deployment. It focuses on introducing DPDK as 
 a technology\, its core components\, and explaining how it can be used in 
 an Openstack deployment to improve the network virtualization. The present
 ation illustrates the layout of a DPDK enabled openvswitch deployment exp
 laining how packets flow within this layout and where performance improvem
 ents are achieved. The presentation ends by briefly showing a comparison 
 of the virtual network performance of a traditional deployment vs a DPDK e

 provider. FreeIPA is an Identity and Authentication management solution. I
 n this presentation\, we describe integrating keystone with FreeIPA as the
  backend identity provider using OpenID Connect as the federation protocol
 . This setup eases the burden of user account administration within OpenSt
 ack providing users access to the Horizon dashboard and OpenStackClient to
 ols using existing FreeIPA credentials. We describe the development of a s
 elf service web portal for users to manage an API key\, a new authenticati
 on plugin for keystone\, and integrating an OAuth2/OpenID consent endpoint
  for FreeIPA. Access control is provided by a custom ACL extension in the 
 federated keystone driver pulling groups and projects directly from FreeIP
 A. This work is supported by Aristotle\, a NSF DIBBs funded federated clou

 problem. ProxyFS enables simultaneous object (S3 and Swift) and filesystem
  access (NFS or SMB) to the same data. At the same time\, ProxyFS is a com

  improved IPv6 support on storage services and we are closer to supporting
  a cloud fully operating with IPv6. However\, the transition of a cloud to
  IPv6 is not a trivial task\, as the network design change comes with its 
 own set of challenges.\nIn this presentation\, we will give an introductio

 o build up an "Agile Infrastructure" -- centered around an OpenStack based
  private cloud. Since then\, the CERN cloud has grown to ~300k cores and s
 upports not only the physics programme\, but also the majority of administ
 rative and support services.In this 5-year perspective\, we will review so
 me of our operational war stories. Concepts to simplify day-to-day operati
 ons\, such as automating/outsourcing tasks via a job scheduler/orchestrato
 r or the introduction of staged rollouts to mitigate deployment risks will
  be presented alongside experiences from cloud-wide campaigns\, such as th
 e handling of security vulnerabilities\, the mass-migration of guests due 
 to hardware retirements\, or the elimination of a physical/virtual perform
 ance gap. The solutions to puzzling issues\, such as intermittent VM shutd
 owns or data loss on reboots\, will also be unveiled.

DESCRIPTION:In a paradigm where operators are deploying OpenStack using Ku
 bernetes\, difficulties surrounding common issues such as authentication a
 nd policy enforcement multiply as OpenStack and Kubernetes have different 
 ecosystems. In the case of policy decision point\, OpenStack leverages key
 stone and oslo.policy\, while Kubernetes provides mechanism to use externa
 l policy engine.\nThis talk proposes a proof of concept to leverage a sing
 le external policy decision point (PDP) engine that would centralize PDP f
 or both OpenStack and Kubernetes. Effort to leverage external system such 
 as Apache Fortress was considered\, but the introduction of java to both O
 penStack's python code base and Kubernetes's golang code base proved chall
 enging. This talk proposes an alternative solution: Open Policy Agent (htt
 p://www.openpolicyagent.org/). As this is designed with cloud native envir
 onment in mind\, this can be adapted by oslo.policy to centralize policy-b
 ased control.

 that are documented in the OpenStack Security Guide to ensure your cloud d
 eployment is secure and not vulnerable to attacks. While implementing thes
 e best practices and is often the goal\, few deployments have visibility i
 nto their compliance with these guidelines – and even fewer have an auto

DESCRIPTION:Upgrading directly from Juno to Ocata is something the OpenSta
 ck community never intended for anyone to do\, however we at Oath managed 
 it with almost zero impact on our customers. A key piece of this task was 
 running five database migrations across three components (Nova\, Glance\, 
 and Keystone)\, which took about an hour. Related work leading up to this 
 migration was the re-imaging of almost 1\,000 HVs to upgrade the OS and Li
 bvirt\, and also migrating our custom patches and plugins to work with the
  Ocata code base. During this entire process\, any given VM was only down 
 for a few hours during the HV upgrade\, while the Nova API had even less d
 owntime. We are currently expanding on this work for the Juno to Ocata upg
 rade of Ironic and Neutron in our Bare Metal clusters and will publish det
 ails on this at a later date.

  compute host and it's hosted Guest VMs. Such work enables  capabilities
  as 'active' / white-box type monitoring of the VM and Applications within
  the VM\,  graceful notifications of potentially service-affecting admin

DESCRIPTION: \nThe Multicloud is a reality with users balancing the need

  other things to drive to a solution that solves business needs. Minimizin

 ritical to ensure that networking does not overwhelm the deployment.\nOpen
 NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol)is a much better alternative for connec
 tivity than multiple site to site VPN tunnels to form a mesh. It provides 
 a mechanism to enable a fully meshed network between the different endpoin
 ts using multipoint GRE and IPSec. A Routing protocol is used to exchange 
 Route information. The dynamic nature of the protocol minimizes configurat
 ion changes with changes to the topology. We share our experience along wi

DESCRIPTION:Access control plays a very important role for both the cloud 
 providers and tenants to make optimal use of the OpenStack Features. Today
  Role Based Access Control rules are fixed before deployment on an OpenSta
 ck instance into a datacenter. Any changes to these roles\, is a very manu
 al and tedious process that causes consistency issues across 100s of deplo
 yment and ends up in creating a snow flake deployment environment. Since g
 ranular roles are not available\, users are tend to be given privileged ro
 les. Higher privilege access causes a lot of issues including inadvertent 
 deletes\, access to  tenant data\, and other security issues. With Dynami
 c RBAC\, it provides the flexibility for Cloud Administrators to define st
 ringent RBAC rules in real time and apply/activate these roles immediately
  eliminating the need to the next deployment cycle and tightening any secu
