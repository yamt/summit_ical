The focus of this project is the implementation of a declarative platform to introduce OpenStack on Kubernetes, and the lifecycle management of the resulting cloud. Airship achieves this by managing the lifecycle of the entire stack, from the baremetal infrastructure and network configuration, to the Docker configuration and Kubernetes cluster, as well as OpenStack. It does this with the scale, speed, resiliency, flexibility and operational predictability demanded of Network Clouds at scale.<\/p>\n<p>This presentation provides an overview of the Airship project and its recent transition to the OpenStack foundation. You can expect to learn what services and components make up the Airship project as well as how they work together to provide declarative and predictable lifecycle management for your cloud and the advantages this brings for operators. We will review how this is leveraged today by several companies and how you can get started using and contributing to the project.<\/p>\n<p>At its core, the Airship project has four main objectives:<\/p>\n<p><strong>BE DECLARATIVE <\/strong><br \/>Sites are declared using YAML. This includes both hard assets such as network configuration and bare metal hosts as well as soft assets like helm charts, their overrides, and container images. You manage the document and Airship implements it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ONE WORKFLOW FOR LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT <\/strong><br \/>We needed a system that was predictable with life cycle management at its core. This meant ensuring we had one workflow that handled both initial deployments as well as future site updates. In other words, there should be virtually nothing different when interacting with a new deployment or providing an an update to an existing site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CONTAINERS AS THE NEW UNIT OF SOFTWARE DELIVERY<\/strong> <br \/>Containers are the unit of software delivery for Airship. Everything is a container. This allows us to predictably promote hermetically sealed containers from development, to testing, and finally production with confidence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FLEXIBLE FOR DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES AND SOFTWARE<\/strong> <br \/>Airship is delivering environments both very small and large with a wide range of configurations.

However many OpenStack deployments have limited monitoring tools and as a result enginteers lack visibility into the workings of the OpenStack environment. In this track you will learn about an OpenStack native monitoring tool called Monasca (Monitoring As A Service At Scale) that provides visibility into OpenStack environments. Monasca provides visibility of compute, block storage, image service, authentication, networking, and more. <br \/><br \/>In this presentation we plan to cover:<br \/><br \/>- A tour of OP5's implementation of Monasca<br \/>- How to deploy Monasca on bare metal and within OpenStack<br \/>- Best practices for OpenStack monitoring<br \/><br \/>About OP5<br \/><br \/>OP5 has developed an enterprise level monitoring solution with full support for OpenStack. It is based upon the OpenStack project Monasca, meaning a high performing scalable fault tolerant solution from start.<br \/><br \/>Monasca is based on microservice architecture which enables high scalability, both horizontally and vertically, and as a result OP5's monitoring solution is able to process millions of metrics per second.<br \/><br \/>OP5's monitoring solution for OpenStack can also handle constant data streams being both pulled and pushed from within the environment. The architecture is built on a highly-performant message bus capable of ingesting a constant flow of data streams as opposed to a master-slave polling for events.<br \/><br \/>Our solution supports agent authentication through Keystone, a OpenStack authentication project. The use of tenants make it possible to separate authentication and authorization on a per-project-basis, and It makes it possible to separate departments or customers sharing the same platform, giving a reliable, multi-tenant solution.<br \/><br \/>In the same vein as OP5's other monitoring solutions, this is based upon robust APIs enabling integrations with other applications for analytics and visualization, such as Grafana.<\/p>","start_epoch":1526909400,"end_epoch":1526910600,"start_datetime":"2018-05-21 13:30:00","end_datetime":"2018-05-21 13:50:00","start_time":"1:30pm","end_time":"1:50pm","date_nice":"Mon 21","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":372,"type_id":158,"rsvp_link":"","has_rsvp":false,"rsvp_external":true,"rsvp_seat_type":"N\/A","sponsors_id":[1018],"category_group_ids":[83],"tags_id":[],"going":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"summit_id":24,"time_zone_id":"America\/Vancouver","attendees_schedule_count":160,"track_id":210,"attachment_url":"","to_record":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/vancouver-2018\/summit-schedule\/events\/21806\/monitoring-openstack-with-monasca-best-practices","social_summary":"Monitoring OpenStack with Monasca Best Practices"},{"id":21590,"title":"OpenStackSDKs - Project Update","class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p>Project Updates cover the latest changes in the project.

This session will answer those questions and more, walking through what's real and what's hype and show how customers are using OpenStack to not only solve real-world problems and power next-generation applications, but also how it's a critical part of a hybrid cloud infrastructure. You will learn how to align workloads to the right infrastructure and how to develop a cloud strategy that works for your organization.

It is crucial to provide support for different kinds of workloads by adding functionality even if it is considered somewhat old-fashioned.<br \/><br \/>Development of the volume multi-attach feature started in 2014 and the first version was released in Queens. We will guide you through the journey of the development process and beyond the history lesson will highlight the use cases behind the high demand from users and vendors alike.<br \/><br \/>You will learn about the functionality including the API design, caveats and efforts put into the CI testing with Tempest and Zuulv3 and plans for improvements. This talk will be valuable for operators, users, and contributors and give a glimpse into the work of a complicated cross-project change developed by numerous contributors from different vendors.<\/p>","start_epoch":1526922600,"end_epoch":1526925000,"start_datetime":"2018-05-21 17:10:00","end_datetime":"2018-05-21 17:50:00","start_time":"5:10pm","end_time":"5:50pm","date_nice":"Mon 21","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":362,"type_id":160,"rsvp_link":"","has_rsvp":false,"rsvp_external":true,"rsvp_seat_type":"N\/A","sponsors_id":[],"category_group_ids":[83],"tags_id":[4591,4592,493,34,4590,14,4624],"going":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"summit_id":24,"time_zone_id":"America\/Vancouver","attendees_schedule_count":57,"track_id":217,"attachment_url":"","to_record":true,"url":"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/vancouver-2018\/summit-schedule\/events\/20850\/the-multi-release-multi-project-road-to-volume-multi-attach","social_summary":"Learn about the volume multi-attach feature worked on by several people over several releases.","speakers_id":[5590,14088,1918],"moderator_id":292,"level":"Intermediate","status":"accepted"},{"id":21402,"title":"Storage for Data Platforms","class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p>Data volume is growing at an unprecedented rate, often without consummate growth in computation needs. The world that lead to the emergence of the tenets laid out in the GFS and Map Reduce papers has seen a dramatic transformation, with over a decade of hardware improvements. Disaggregation of compute and storage is now commonplace, championed by organizations like Netflix, Amazon, and Airbnb. Pushing storage down a layer and treating it as an infrastructure service allows data platform teams to focus on increasing the pace of innovation higher up the stack.<\/p>\n<p>Engineers building data platforms on OpenStack clouds expect a varity of storage services. Object storage is increasingly becoming the centerpiece of data platforms, as it enables in-situ analysis from elastic workload clusters, low cost, and massive scalability.

This solution allows vendors to determine how their containers are built and managed while continuing to stay out-of-tree.
