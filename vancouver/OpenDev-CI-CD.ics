DESCRIPTION:Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV) facilitates the development and 
 evolution of NFV components across various open source ecosystems. OpenDay
 light (ODL) is a modular open platform for customizing and automating netw
 orks of any size and scale. OPNFV and ODL communities have been working t
 ogether in order to establish seamless flow of software across the communi
 ties by following and applying CI/CD and DevOps principles and best practi
 ces. One crucial piece of this is ODL Continuous Delivery Pipelines which
  make the latest & greatest versions of the software available frequently 
 to OPNFV and anyone else interested in them in different forms such as pac
 kages\, containers and so on. OPNFV XCI heavily utilizes ODL CD Pipelines
  to create integrated solutions for next generation telecom networks. Thi
 s helps other communities and users of ODL to develop new features\, fix b
 ugs\, create integrated solutions\, and innovate much faster than before.
  \nDuring this keynote\, we will talk about the challenges our communitie
 s faced during the early phases and how these communities overcome them by
  applying CI/CD and DevOps principles and practices.

SUMMARY:Why OpenStack People Should Pay Attention to Spinnaker

DESCRIPTION:At Mirantis we first heard of Spinnaker when one of our custom
 ers asked us to implement it as a Horizon replacement on top of Mirantis O
 penStack a few years back. This prompted us to start digging to see if tha
 t could be “the thing.” But what we heard back from both internal stak
 eholders and customers was along the line of: “Nah… it’s a CI/CD thi
 ng\, not relevant. Show me containers and K8S instead.” In this talk\, w
 e’ll walk you through the journey that led the OpenStack company to star
 t paying attention to Spinnaker and explain why the two communities should
  work closer together.

DESCRIPTION:Open source container technologies have become an important co
 mponent of application testing and microservices deployments in CI/CD pipe
 lines recently. Benefits for using containers in testing include better ut
 ilization of testing resources and ability to easily have identical enviro
 nments for local development\, testing and production microservices. Addit
 ionally\, Jenkins has plugins for popular containerization platforms inclu
 ding Kubernetes (https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin) and Apach
 e Mesos (https://github.com/jenkinsci/mesos-plugin). The talk will conclud
 e with a demonstration of a simple\, fully open source\, CI/CD pipeline us
 ing Jenkins\, GitLab and Apache Mesos via DC/OS.

DESCRIPTION:Much of the recent acceleration and advancement in the devops 
 tooling landscape and community has some relation to the increased adoptio
 n of and evolution of the public Cloud. And yet\, the Cloud is still in it
 s infancy\, and will continue to evolve at a rapid pace\, changing how we 
 look at\, consume and find new opportunities in its ecosystem. How does th
 is inform the opportunities in devops? Do the profiles of the users we pri
 oritize change? What are the things we need to do well as the consumption 
 of Cloud hits new scales and organizations approach it fundamentally diffe
 rently? In this talk\, I share thoughts on the kinds of change in Cloud th
 at the Spinnaker team is prioritizing as signals\, what we see as the thin
 gs that we need to do well in the near to mid term\, and some tangible thi
 ngs we are working on in line with those observations.

SUMMARY:Free Software Needs Free Tools

UID:21706@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Over the last decade\, free software developers have been repe
 atedly tempted by development tools that offer the ability to build free s
 oftware more efficiently or powerfully. The only cost\, we are told\, is t
 hat the tools themselves are nonfree or run as network services with code 
 we cannot see\, copy\, or run ourselves. In this short talk\, I’ll show 
 how these decisions to embrace nonfree and private development tools under
 mine our credibility in advocating for software freedom and compromise our
  freedom\, and that of our users\, in ways that we should reject.

DESCRIPTION:Various initiatives have been going on across open source comm
 unities to address the challenges in end-to-end integration & testing\, es
 pecially when there is a need to bring different open source components to
 gether to see how well they work in system context.\nHowever\, working on 
 the problems that are common and span across different communities in an i
 solated manner is not beneficial for the ecosystem since what is done by e
 ach of these communities can potentially be shared by others who are worki
 ng on solving similar problems. This includes but not limited to improved 
 way of working\, alignment on CI/CD\, reuse of the tooling.\nRecently\, de
 velopers from open source communities came together and started working on
  things in a collaborative manner. The thinking behind this was that once 
 we get to know each other and start talking\, the rest would be much easie
 r and quicker. The topics of interest are infrastructure\, CI/CD\, integra
 tion & testing so we could look for the answers together.

DESCRIPTION:Continous integration jobs can generate massive volumes of dat
 a. When a job fails\, figuring out what went wrong can be a tedious proces
 s—one that involves investigating logs and discovering the root cause\, 
 often found in a fraction of the total job output.\nIn this workshop\, we
 ’ll show attendees how machine learning can help solve the challenge of 
 anomaly detection in job logs and save time in finding a failure’s root 
 cause. We’ll also demo Zuul v3 and how it can be extended to integrate l
 og processing models. Based on a live dataset of Zuul jobs\, attendees wil
 l use the log-classify project to build a machine learning model and autom
 atically extract anomalies. The workshop organizer will provide instructio
 ns and answer any questions\, but attendees are encouraged to contribute t
 o the discussion.

DESCRIPTION:The OpenStack Infra team runs one of the world’s largest Ope
 n Source CI/CD systems in service of OpenStack’s early decision to mand
 ate that all merges only be performed by automation if and only if all te
 sts pass. Accomplishing this at scale involves a combination of software
  and policy.Zuul is the software engine developed to handle this.Zuul is 
 not OpenStack specific. With the rise of microservices and kubernetes\, t
 he number of multi-repo projects is increasing\, as is the need for CI sy
 stems that understand them. The most recent version ofZuul has been rework
 ed to make it easy for other people\, communities or organizations to har
 ness its power regardless of any relationship with OpenStack.We’ll talk
  about the things that make Zuul special - multi-repository dependencies\
 , optimistic branch prediction and deep Ansible integration. And we’ll 
 walk through how to get started with a private or a public Zuul.

UID:20955@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:CI/CD and DevOps are common practices for webscale software en
 abling rapid development of applications and the business. Usage of DevOps
  requires the automatic management of software components on live systems 
 and the possibility to send feedback from the live systems to the develope
 rs. ETSI NFV defined a multi layer MANO framework to manage the different 
 layers of telecom services. OpenStack\, as the defacto standard VIM\, is a
  key enabler of DevOps in the NFV architecture\, because of its capability
  to dynamically manage workloads. Currently there is an activity within t
 he NFV community to introduce capabilities that allow DevOps and CI/CD co
 ncepts to fit into this framework. In this presentation we will describe 
 the challenges of introducing DevOps practices in the telecom environment
  and we will also describe the planned solutions for these challenges.

DESCRIPTION:We will share our story of CI/CD transformation of 1000s of le
 gacy monolith applications on OpenStack using Blue/Green and Canary contin
 uous delivery strategies. Continuous delivery is becoming increasingly cri
 tical but it still remains a hard problem many enterprises struggle with. 
 We will present lessons learned in the process of achieving new levels of 
 automation on OpenStack. \nCanary upgrades and Blue/Green deployment are t
 he two commonly used patterns to implement continuous delivery. In Canary 
 upgrades\, a small portion of the production traffic is sent to the new ve
 rsion under test. In blue/green deployments\, all the traffic is switched 
 to the new version and programmatically switched back in case the evaluati
 on fails.\nWe will show how to fully automate above steps to achieve true 
 continuous delivery in OpenStack using Ansible and LBaaS. We will show how
  to use analytics to express and automate application evaluation and ML ba
 sed traffic switching without any downtime.

DESCRIPTION:At Oath\, we deploy a heavily customized version of OpenStack

 kage that is deployable in our data centers. We also need fine grained con
 trol over our deployments such that we can swiftly deploy fixes/enhancemen
 ts to single components in a single cluster with minimal downtime. \nWe de
 signed a build platform on our open source tool\, Screwdriver\, which is c
 apable of building and publishing our customized\, self contained packages
  as both RPMs and PyPi packages. We then built CI/CD pipelines using Screw
 driver and Chef which pull down the custom packages that are published by 
 our build system and deploy them individually in minutes. The pipelines ar
 e capable of deploying individual components without redeploying the entir
 e stack. Each cluster has its own pipeline which gives us very fine graine
 d control over our deployments
