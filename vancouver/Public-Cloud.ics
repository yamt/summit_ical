SUMMARY:Lessons learned from public cloud billing

DESCRIPTION:Using OpenStack for a public cloud has a range of challenges\,
  and one of hardest parts is often billing. This is an area deployers may 
 run into some frustrating and unexpected problems.\nDeployers expect a goo
 d billing system to inergrate with their existing ERP system\, but those i
 ntegrations likely need custom features and flexibility.\nThey need to be 
 ready to handle bugs in the telemetry chain (service bugs\, notification b
 ugs\, ceilometer bugs)\, and make sure their billing isn't missing informa
 tion because of it.\nTheir solution needs to be able to handle at least 10
 00+ customers and 50+ metrics/products.\nIn this session\, we will share t
 he first-hand experience about running billing on Catalyst Cloud\, which i
 s a public cloud based in New Zealand.

SUMMARY:Protecting OpenStack Projects with Security Monkey
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T221000Z
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T225000Z
UID:20762@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Security Monkey is an open source security project from Netfli
 x that monitors cloud accounts for policy changes and alerts to insecure o
 r noncompliant configurations. Originally developed for AWS in 2014\, Goog
 le later added support for GCP. We will present our work to integrate Open
 Stack. Available in the 1.0 release\, initial support targets the major co
 mponents of Neutron\, Nova\, and Swift.\nWith Security Monkey\, OpenStack 
 project configurations are continuously audited against defined rules with
  alerts generated for violations (a security group that allows unrestricte
 d SSH to an Internet-facing VM or public Swift containers). By keeping an 
 inventory and history of all deltas\, owners have visibility into when ite
 ms are created\, modified\, or removed. Security Monkey can be easily exte
 nded/customized and provides a dashboard to view open issues and the overa
 ll security posture of monitored OpenStack projects. We will perform a liv
 e demo against a public instance (devstack as backup).

DESCRIPTION:Public Cloud is one of the most important adoptions of OpenSt
 ack\, and has received more attention for OpenStack developers in recent 
 releases.\nIn this topic\, we would like to share what has been done in Op
 enStack core projects in recent releases in order to shorten the gap betwe
 en upstream OpenStack and public cloud customer requirements.\nWe will als
 o share our true story of how we ran a worldwide OpenStack-based public cl
 oud\, and what is still missing for OpenStack to make the operation of Ope
 nStack-based public cloud easier and more reliable.

DESCRIPTION:In the past 2017\, China Mobile has published its distributed 
 shared file system service in the public cloud. It's based on manila with 
 GlusterFs backend and use NFS-Ganesha to export the NFS protocol\, it can 
 provide service for both virtual machine users and bare metal users at the
  same time.We'd like to share how we build it\, including the driver integ
 ration and optimization\, the network solutions and the way to solve the S
 PF issues.\nFocus on the following aspects:1. GlusterFS and NFS-Ganesha in
 tegration\, why and how.2. What did we do to make NFS-Ganesha driver effic
 ienly and reliability.3. Network solution to make virtual machines and bar
 e metal servers being netowork connected in L3 layer with NFS-Ganesha node
 \, setting ACL via IPs.4. How to solve the SPF issues of NFS-Ganesha in bo
 th of management layer and data layer.5. Solve the SPF issue of manila sha
 re service\,  how to transfer the management relationship from the offline
  share service to the online share services.

SUMMARY:Closing Automation and DNS Security Gaps in Today's Dynamic World

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180522T184500Z
UID:21804@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:Two critical DNS gaps occur within traditional NFV and contain
 ers deployments - lack of IP address automation and DNS-based security ris
 ks. In this demo\, Infoblox will highlight how Carrier-grade DNS and IP ad
 dress management (IPAM) closes these gaps. Infoblox helps speed deployment
 s and improve visibility by automating provisioning and discovery of dynam
 ic virtual and container resources by integrating in your orchestration an
 d ONAP processes. Even though security is top of mind for every telco and 
 organization across the world\, security holes for DNS are still a major c
 oncern. Over 95% of tested organizations allowed data exfiltration via DNS
  tunnels because existing tools allow open DNS communications. In this dem
 o\, Infoblox will highlight how data can easily be stolen via DNS\, and mo
 re importantly\, how to stop this risk.

DESCRIPTION:You might have heard of it - the largest public cloud footprin
 t called OpenStack Public Cloud passport program. The Passport Program is 
 an initiative from the Public Cloud Working Group to provide a unified way
  for users to access free trial accounts from OpenStack public cloud provi
 ders around the world\, which allows them to experience the freedom\, perf
 ormance and interoperability of open source infrastructure. \nDuring this
  session we will show how the program have evolved during its first months
  in the open\, what new cloud members that have joined\, what more the pro
 gram offers to both the cloud consumer as well as for public cloud provide
 r. We will also tell you how we see the future for this program\, but also
  invite you to join the discussion!

DESCRIPTION:If you have several clouds at differant regions\, how to manag
 e your clouds resources between these clouds flexibly. For example\, creat
 ing 100 virtual mathines or more at these regions respectively. If you do 
 it manually\, it is a nightmare. Terraform maybe is a nice choice! In this
  topic\, I will give an outline of Terraform\, and then talk about how to
  develop a new provider for Terraform\, and what should be noticed in the 
 devoloping.

DESCRIPTION:Highly available and resilient authentication and authorisatio
 n are cornerstones of any cross-region service\, particularly so for geogr
 aphically distributed public clouds. Though largely invisible to end users
 \, the smallest performance blip will be painfully obvious to all.  We pre
 sent the critical aspects to be aware of when designing and implementing m
 ulti-region Keystone services\, and how we overcame them to reach a stable
 \, fast\, and scalable offering.

DESCRIPTION:It has never been a better time to be a developer! Thanks to c
 loud computing\, deploying our applications is much easier than it used to
  be\, especially after Function-as-a-Service emerged. Despite the big name
 s such as AWS Lambda\, Google Cloud Functions\, etc. how the OpenStack end
  users(especially public cloud users) can get benefits from FaaS as well?\
 nQinling\, an official OpenStack project which was approved at the end of 
 Queens development cycle\, is aiming at providing FaaS for OpenStack. As p
 art of the OpenStack ecosystem\, it is tightly integrated with most of the
  other OpenStack services in order to empower the service users or applica
 tion developers.\nIn this presentation\, I will revisit the challenges tha
 t current FaaS implementations are facing\, and how we solved(or partially
  solved) those issues in Qinling. Most importantly\, this topic will also 
 cover how Qinling interacts with other open source community(e.g. Kubernet
 es\, Kata Containers) during its implementation.

DESCRIPTION:You are operating an OpenStack cloud. Great! You are consideri
 ng to use OpenStack to run real world applications\, processing sensitive 
 data like in financial\, healthcare or government institutions. Wonderful
 ! But wait – how to provide the security functionality to meet the strin
 gent requirements regarding user data needed by that kind of applications.
  OpenStack will not do that for you out of the box!\nHelp is on its way.\n
 We developed an OpenStack extension that ensures confidentiality and integ
 rity of user data that is processed\, stored and exchanged between highly 
 distributed cloud components. It encrypts user data prior to cloud entry. 
 The encryption keys are managed by the OpenStack client. They are not stor
 ed in the cloud and remain safely in the users' hands.We will discuss the 
 status quo of OpenStack security regarding user data\, explain the concept
 s of our extension and present a live demo of our prototype to meet the st
 ringent requirements regarding sensitive user data.
