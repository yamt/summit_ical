DESCRIPTION:It's well known that we're generally doing a bad job at SSH ke
 y management: man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability on first connection\;
  private key sharing\; leaving old keys in the authorized_keys file\; lack
  of user-level audit\; etc. Companies like Uber and Facebook have blogged 
 about these challenges and how they tackled them internally. Uber also Ope
 n-sourced code that handles the case where a certificate expires or is rev
 oked after login.SSH certificates part of the solution\, but management co
 mplexity persists. At Huawei\, we proposed and are leading Tatu: an Open S
 ource project that makes SSH management for Cloud environments effortless 
 and secure.Tatu provides: CA capabilities\; automatic installation of host
  certificates in servers\; user SSH certificates\; expiry and revocation o
 f certificates\; strong private key generation\; key rotation\; bastion ma
 nagement\; DNS integration.

DESCRIPTION:Using OpenStack for a public cloud has a range of challenges\,
  and one of hardest parts is often billing. This is an area deployers may 
 run into some frustrating and unexpected problems.\nDeployers expect a goo
 d billing system to inergrate with their existing ERP system\, but those i
 ntegrations likely need custom features and flexibility.\nThey need to be 
 ready to handle bugs in the telemetry chain (service bugs\, notification b
 ugs\, ceilometer bugs)\, and make sure their billing isn't missing informa
 tion because of it.\nTheir solution needs to be able to handle at least 10
 00+ customers and 50+ metrics/products.\nIn this session\, we will share t
 he first-hand experience about running billing on Catalyst Cloud\, which i
 s a public cloud based in New Zealand.

DESCRIPTION:Security Monkey is an open source security project from Netfli
 x that monitors cloud accounts for policy changes and alerts to insecure o
 r noncompliant configurations. Originally developed for AWS in 2014\, Goog
 le later added support for GCP. We will present our work to integrate Open
 Stack. Available in the 1.0 release\, initial support targets the major co
 mponents of Neutron\, Nova\, and Swift.\nWith Security Monkey\, OpenStack 
 project configurations are continuously audited against defined rules with
  alerts generated for violations (a security group that allows unrestricte
 d SSH to an Internet-facing VM or public Swift containers). By keeping an 
 inventory and history of all deltas\, owners have visibility into when ite
 ms are created\, modified\, or removed. Security Monkey can be easily exte
 nded/customized and provides a dashboard to view open issues and the overa
 ll security posture of monitored OpenStack projects. We will perform a liv
 e demo against a public instance (devstack as backup).

 e Barbican project. OnRamp built and deployed a volume encryption service 
 for their Virtual Private Cloud\, allowing users to encrypt their volumes.
  Each volume the VPC users provision is encrypted with a unique key\, ensu
 ring that their data is not readable by other tenants in the cloud.\nUsing
  lessons learned from OnRamp&rsquo\;s VPC\, OpenStack Engineer Duncan Wann
 amaker will review the design journey from soup to nuts\, including outlin
 ing requirements\, choosing from the available open source platforms\, dev
 eloping the architecture\, and implementing the volume encryption. Learn f
 rom the challenges OnRamp encountered with a multi-tenant deployment\, and
  see a demo of how to create an encryption key\, integrate Cinder with Bar
 bican\, and create and attach encrypted volumes.

DESCRIPTION:The OpenStack Passport Program was developed to get OpenStack 
 newcomers quick and easy access to OpenStack through a partnership with te
 n OpenStack public cloud providers. It is touted "...to let you experience
  the freedom\, performance and interoperability of open source infrastruct
 ure." As two OpenStack Ambassadors (U.S. and Canada)\, we're always lookin
 g for new ways to showcase OpenStack and this sounded great! So we signed 
 up - for all 10!\nAnd with ten different cloud providers making up OpenSta
 ck Passport\, you're going to get ten different experiences ranging the si
 gn-up process\, the payment mechanisms\, the version of OpenStack\, and th
 e OpenStack components provided. We're not saying that any particular clou
 d is better than the other\, just that they're different... So before you 
 sign up for OpenStack Passport\, be sure to hear what we have to say!\n \n

 as a option to bring the actual data into Glance in form of web-download P
 OC that is feature par with Images API v1 copy-from and will be last step 
 to enable us removing the Images API v1 from the codebase during Rocky cyc
 le and further down in the flow as operator defined plugins to process the

 WS products and discuss the commonalities and differences in product featu
 res and architecture. We will dive into the ways both platforms solve comp
 lex business challenges and how each platform is uniquely suited to solvin
 g certain use cases. Of course\, no AWS/OpenStack presentation would be co
 mplete without discussing hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios and how to use 
 some of the products we discuss in a multi-modal architecture.

DESCRIPTION:It has never been a better time to be a developer! Thanks to c
 loud computing\, deploying our applications is much easier than it used to
  be\, especially after Function-as-a-Service emerged. Despite the big name
 s such as AWS Lambda\, Google Cloud Functions\, etc. how the OpenStack end
  users(especially public cloud users) can get benefits from FaaS as well?\
 nQinling\, an official OpenStack project which was approved at the end of 
 Queens development cycle\, is aiming at providing FaaS for OpenStack. As p
 art of the OpenStack ecosystem\, it is tightly integrated with most of the
  other OpenStack services in order to empower the service users or applica
 tion developers.\nIn this presentation\, I will revisit the challenges tha
 t current FaaS implementations are facing\, and how we solved(or partially
  solved) those issues in Qinling. Most importantly\, this topic will also 
 cover how Qinling interacts with other open source community(e.g. Kubernet
 es\, Kata Containers) during its implementation.

DESCRIPTION:You are operating an OpenStack cloud. Great! You are consideri
 ng to use OpenStack to run real world applications\, processing sensitive 
 data like in financial\, healthcare or government institutions. Wonderful
 ! But wait – how to provide the security functionality to meet the strin
 gent requirements regarding user data needed by that kind of applications.
  OpenStack will not do that for you out of the box!\nHelp is on its way.\n
 We developed an OpenStack extension that ensures confidentiality and integ
 rity of user data that is processed\, stored and exchanged between highly 
 distributed cloud components. It encrypts user data prior to cloud entry. 
 The encryption keys are managed by the OpenStack client. They are not stor
 ed in the cloud and remain safely in the users' hands.We will discuss the 
 status quo of OpenStack security regarding user data\, explain the concept
 s of our extension and present a live demo of our prototype to meet the st
 ringent requirements regarding sensitive user data.
