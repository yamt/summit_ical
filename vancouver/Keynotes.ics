SUMMARY:Let's Build the Open Infrastructure Economy

DESCRIPTION:We started this OpenStack mission by forming a community of li
 ke minded people who wanted to build open cloud software. Over time\, the 
 community grew to include people who successfully combined OpenStack with 
 many different open source components to automate their infrastructure.\nN
 ow that we’ve become a community of 90\,000 people in 180 countries that
  build and operate infrastructure\, there is a much larger opportunity to 
 bring open infrastructure to new markets. From edge computing\, to AI\, to
  Container Security\, to CI/CD\, the work we do to ensure that the infrast
 ructure our economy relies on is truly open has never been more vital.\nWe
 ’re also lucky to be joined by leaders in open infrastructure\, includin
 g Jim Blair from Zuul to talk CI/CD\, Melvin Hillsman from OpenLab\, Ildik
 o Vansca and Beth Cohen from the edge computing working group\, and Amy Le
 eland & Xu Wang who will introduce us to Kata Containers.\n

SUMMARY:OpenStack and Kubernetes in a Hybrid Cloud World
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T164500Z
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20180521T170000Z
UID:21894@openstacksummitboston2017
DESCRIPTION:OpenStack has given organizations more choice in an infrastruc
 ture market once threatened by domination of a few hyperscale providers.
  Kubernetes lowered switching costs for organizations looking foralternat
 ives. And although some thought Kubernetes and OpenStack might compete\, 
 the two technologies are actually complementary\, not competitive. Learn 
 how OpenStack and Kubernetes each have an important role to play in a hyb
 rid cloud world\, and how we in the community can help shape this future
  by making OpenStack and Kubernetes work better together.

DESCRIPTION:As we move toward a world where everything is smart and connec
 ted\, our experiences are becoming increasingly digitized\, resulting in a
  massive flood of data. We are using the power of that data to transform s
 ome of the most exciting areas of human activity. Edge computing\, contain
 er technology and open source continue to be the driving forces behind the
  next wave of the technology revolution. Edge computing is critical to the
  massive growth generated by connected devices and sensors\, whereas conta
 iners are set to usher the third wave of cloud computing enabling micro-se
 rvices. Imad Sousou\, corporate vice president in the Software and Service
 s Group and general manager of the Open Source Technology Center for Intel
  Corporation\, will highlight how Intel is uniquely positioned to power th
 e cloud to the edge and drive the increasingly smart\, connected world.
