DESCRIPTION:OpenDev CI/CD keynotes will feature speakers highlighting emer
 ging use cases and architecture show-and-tells around continuous integrati
 on\, deployment and delivery (CI/CD). In a software defined economy\, spee
 d of delivery is a key metric for every organization that wants to stay co
 mpetitive. The days of annual\, monthly or even weekly releases are long g
 one\, and today’s most mature organizations ship code many times every d
 ay. To enable this\, software delivery today takes advantage of new techno
 logy and methods to automate and manage the process of getting code from d
 evelopers to production. You’ll hear from community leaders and users of
  CI/CD open systems like Spinnaker\, Jenkins\, Zuul\, Mesos and TravisCI w
 ho are defining new ways to develop and manage software within open infras
 tructure. Specific topics and speakers will be shared at a later time.
