DESCRIPTION:We deployed a nearly 200 nodes OpenStack environment\, in orde
 r to more easily manage virtual disks\, all the instances are booting from
  volumes. We use Rally to evaluate the performance of this cluster. The fa
 ct is\, compared to boot from local disks\, booting from volumes often lea
 d to failure.These failure are largely due to the low performance of Cinde
 r. In this presentation\, we will discuss problems found during performanc
 e testing in detail.Database\, threading model\, deployment architecture a
 nd other factors will affect the performance of cinder largely. Under cert
 ain conditions all of these can become a performance bottleneck. We will i
 ntroduce these separately.Finally\, we will give our conclusions and solut
 ions in order to help everyone to be more convenient to use cinder.

DESCRIPTION:This is a medium to advanced session on two relatively new fea
 tures in Cinder.  First we will look at the new replication feature which
  will be available in the Mitaka release. We will show how to configure a
 nd utilize replicated volumes in your storage catalog.  We plan to have 2
  short demos of replication configurations\, one from SolidFire and one fr
 om NetApp. In the second part of the presentation we will discuss the conf
 iguration details necessary in Cinder (and OpenStack) to allow live migrat
 ion of instances to work with block storage attached.

 uch Ceph\, NFS\, iSCSI. Our talk is geared toward end users\, administrato
 rs and architects\, and will cover both in-cloud and multi-cloud migration
 \, which is especially important in the context of an inevitable cloud upg
 rade.Use cases include cloud migration\, storage scaling and disaster reco
 very will illustrate tools and techniques appropriate for each.We are team
 ing up to tender tales\, tools and techniques to technical teams in order 
 to transfer troves of terabytes to tenable targets.

DESCRIPTION:Cinder has seen explosive growth offering over 70 backend stor
 age providers.  Now we're seeing the arms race begin with Vendors and sta
 rt-ups pitching the same sort of trend in Containers.  Did you know howev
 er that it's actually pretty simple to use Cinder to provide your Block St
 orage orchestration for Docker?  Many point out that Containers and OpenS
 tack can be complimentary\, we'll show you one such case. This talk will 
 introduce some of the current functionality in the Docker Volumes API as w
 ell as take a quick look at a number of the options that are out there.  
 There's no single answer\, but there might be an easier path to Persistent
  Block storage in containers than you thought.  We'll show you how you ca
 n use your existing Cinder environment an introduce a Native Docker Cinder
  plugin\, and how some folks are already using this great combination toda
 y!  Not to mention a demo with the potential for spectacular failure that
  you can tweet about and tell all your friends!

 tack and Freezer.This technology provides users unprecedented flexibility 
 and enables them to rebuild\, not only the Cloud Infrastructure\, but also
  any dataset of any size they need to recover on the most suitable locatio
 n.It can happen that Backup/Restore approach does not fit with required RP
 O/RTO\, so in Freezer we are implementing a new layer of orchestration tha
 t allows OpenStack to survive to Disasters\, from the loss of a Compute No
 de to an entire Data Center.Freezer offers a solution for Disaster Recover
 y\, backup and restore as a service with data integrity\, availability and

DESCRIPTION:This presentation begins with a brief overview of Cinder’s h
 istory\, its development in the OpenStack community\, and then provides an
  introduction to its architecture.  This gives new users the pieces they 
 need to understand the basics of using Cinder and its API.With the basic b
 ackground applied\, we dive into more complex concepts like volume types a
 nd how they apply to multiple backends.  Once the user has an understandi
 ng of cinder environments with multiple backends we are able to introduce 
 concepts like retyping and migration.The presentation also includes demons
 trations of how to most effectively leverage Cinder’s CLI and Horizon in
 terfaces.  These interfaces are used to create and manage types\, create 
 volumes using those types and subsequently move the volumes between backen
 ds.

DESCRIPTION:As industry is moving towards cloud\, Object Store has become 
 a choice for storage for many workloads. But\, there will continue to exis
 ts traditional applications which require data to be accessed using file a
 ccess methods like NFS/SMB. So we end up having scenarios where there are 
 applications running anywhere (VMs hosted by openstack or beyond) which ar
 e creating and accessing object data and the same object data is required 
 to be accessed by applications running on other set of VM instances via fi
 le interfaces.Manila\, the OpenStack file share service provides a way to 
 easily  securely configure a file share which can be shared between multip
 le virtual machine instances. On the other hand\, Swiftonfile diskfile imp
 lementation for OpenStack Swift allows objects to be available through fil
 e interface. Commingling these two Openstack technologies uniquely address
 es the common deployments challenged with multiprotocol access and sharing
  of same data across the VM instances.

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack Swift is a storage project in OpenStack\, which real
 izes a highly scalable and robust object storage\, with low operational co
 st.We\, cloud storage team in NTT DATA\, have been offered many projects a
 iming to replace legacy storage to swift\, to store more data more safely 
 with lower cost. In those project\, we were often required not to change t
 he existing systems. However\, this requirement causes a problem in our in
 tegration\, when they are so "legacy" that they rarely support REST API. M
 any systems are still on the way to turning to cloud-native architectures 
 (like REST API)\, and we have seen many demands to introduce cloud system 
 into no-cloud system\, as the first step for ther turning.In this session\
 , we will explain some example cases from our Swift projects and how we so
 lved this interface problem to intergrate Swift\, very useful cloud techno
 logy\, into the existing "legacy" systems.

DESCRIPTION:A new feature in development for OpenStack Swift improves secu
 rity by encrypting object data at rest.OpenStack Swift provides reliable a
 nd scalable object storage that has been deployed in many successful produ
 ction environments. The Swift developer community has recently been workin
 g on enhancing Swifts security by adding the capability to encrypt object 
 content stored on disk. Our goal is to protect data at rest from an attack
 er that gains physical access to disks. We aim to achieve this with comple
 te transparency to clients i.e. with no API changes\, other than optional 
 extensions to support client provided keys when desired.This talk will des
 cribe and demonstrate this exciting new feature\, discuss options for inte
 gration with key management services such as Barbican\, and look ahead at 
 future work to additionally encrypt account and container metadata.

SUMMARY:Leverage the Advantage of Multiple Storage Backends in Glance

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Currently cinder-volume can support multiple backends and each
  nova-compute could choose its storage backend. But glance doesn't support
  that which means we could store images in only one backend no matter how 
 many cinder drivers we used. More and more users want to leverage the adva
 ntages of ceph and enterprise storage. But with the restriction of glance 
 we could only get images in one place and copy to another storage if we bo
 ot virtual machines in different backends. After improving glance to suppo
 rt multiple storage backends\, we can use different storage resources in m
 ultiple availability zones. You can pull images from ceph and boot virtual
  machines with the COW features. At the meantime\, we're allowed to use an
 other storage pool without pulling images from ceph. This is meaningful wh
 en we're using distributed storage system and enterprise storage solution.

DESCRIPTION:Would you like to double performance without changing a line o

 e a radical turn is needed to optimize performance and a Just In Time (JIT
 ) compilation is the direction they have all turned. We would argue that n
 ow is the time for Python. In perhaps an extreme case\, Swift’s performa
 nce is greatly affected by the latency of Python’s default  CPython int
 erpreter. Recently Swift throughput was improved 111% on a 15 node storage
  cluster and response time was boosted 87%. This was achieved by using PyP
 y\, the JIT version of Python. This talk will describe a proof-of-concept 
 study using PyPy in production with Swift\, offer a roadmap for broad adop
 tion of PyPy in the Python world\, and provide clear steps for implementin

  write affinity\, in the worst case\, you may lose data when one of the re
 gions is down. On the other hand\, if you disable write/read affinity\, th
 e performance of your cluster may be limited by thetransmissiondelay and b
 andwidth of the network connections between regions. There is no one-size-

 The session begins with a short overview of SwiftOnFile\, which is needed 
 to understand the data placement mechanism for unified file and object acc
