SUMMARY:Making Cloud Interoperability Across OpenStack Vendors a Possibili
 ty Using RefStack
DTSTART:20160425T161500Z
DTEND:20160425T165500Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:RefStack was recently adopted by DefCore as the official test 
 result collection tool that vendors\, operators\, and users can report int
 eroperability test results to. So far many companies have already got thei
 r OpenStack solution certified through RefStack. To apply for OpenStack tr
 ademark licensing programs\, you will need to run Tempest inside of the Re
 fStack Client\, and upload the results to the RefStack Server. Once your r
 esults are uploaded\, you can send a link to the report page to interop@op
 enstack.org.After giving a brief introduction to RefStack\, in this talk\,
  we will discuss the newly implemented features such as:Uploading data as 
 a validated userInterpreting test results per DefCore GuidelinesAssociatin
 g a test run to a specific DefCore Guideline and Target programAssociating
  test results to a product/vendorWe also share what features are in store 
 for RefStack along with some troubleshooting techniques based on the lesso
 ns learned by working with various RefStack users.

SUMMARY:Flat No More! Hierarchical Multitenancy and Projects Acting as Dom
 ains in OpenStack
DTSTART:20160425T161519Z
DTEND:20160425T165559Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Hierarchical multitenancy is available since Kilo and enables 
 a better resource management by creating projects and subprojects in a hie
 rarchical fashion. Among other benefits\, quota management and access cont
 rol are simplified by the use of roles that are inheritable for lower leve
 ls of the hierarchy and this reflects more accurately the responsibilities
  and resource sharing in an organization.Another improvement that we’ve 
 made is the addition of projects acting as domains\, where now\, projects 
 are not only the container of other services’ resources\, but also conta
 in users and other projects\, that once belonged to domains.In this talk\,
  we will present the recently incorporated features\, in which projects co
 uld mirror the real hierarchical structure of organizations and ease resou
 rce management and access control by cloud administrators and how using pr
 ojects acting as domains can make the life of the cloud administrator easi
 er.

SUMMARY:Expanding DBaaS Workloads with OpenStack Trove and Manila
DTSTART:20160425T170500Z
DTEND:20160425T174540Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Until recently\, the OpenStack Trove DBaaS project only used t
 he Cinder block storage service for database storage. With joint developme
 nt work from NetApp\, Red Hat and Tesora\, it is now possible to run datab
 ase workloads on OpenStack using Manila-based file shares.This session wil
 l describe the implementation and the benefits of supporting databases wit
 h persistent storage on Manila including the benefits in live migration\, 
 clustering\, and database backup and restore.In this presentation\, one ca
 n learn how Trove and Manila can support a wide range of new and legacy da
 tabase workloads in OpenStack with both file and block storage.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:As part of the OpenStack planning process\, the development te
 ams have started tracking development tasks that will span across multiple
  6-month cycles. The list of "Themes" was presented to the community at th
 e Tokyo summit. In this session\, we will provide an update on the status 
 of these epics as we near the Mitaka release and will update the plans for
  Newton and Ocata

DTEND:20160425T194059Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Managing the elasticity\, serviceability and distributions on 
 an OpenStack cloud is always a challenge. Senlin was developed as a generi
 c clustering service for managing homogeneous objects exposed by any OpenS
 tack services\, e.g. Heat stacks\, Nova servers etc. This talk is a deep d
 ive into the architecture design\, the plugin mechanisms and the built-in 
 profile and policy supports in Senlin. With a real-world usage scenario\, 
 the presenter will show you how Senlin makes the creation and management o
 f resource pools an easy task.

SUMMARY:Orchestrating Tasks with Mistral Workflow Service
DTSTART:20160425T195000Z
DTEND:20160425T203040Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:If you have a lot of tasks/processes running in your environme
 nt then task orchestration becomes a huge task itself. Most of complicated
  processes consist of lots of steps\, which should be executed in particul
 ar sequence and with pre-conditions. Such steps may be time consuming and 
 difficult to manage manually.Mistral can automate such orchestration of co
 mputational steps and provide fault tolerances\, scalability\, state manag
 ement\, correct execution order\, parallelism and synchronization as well 
 as monitoring capabilities that allow to observe state of running processe
 s (workflows in Mistral terminology).In today world\, cloud provides lots 
 of services and operator or administrator needs to manually manage the day
  to day tasks on those services. For example:* Scheduled periodic backups 
 of VMs or volumes. * Management of VM migration\, evacuation etc. * Long
 -living chains of administrative actions * Managing infrastructure at sca
 leIn this session I would like to tell about Mistral Workflow Service and 
 its use cases.

SUMMARY:The Big Tent\, One Year Later
DTSTART:20160425T195000Z
DTEND:20160425T203040Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:One year ago the OpenStack project completed the transition to
  a new project structure and governance model\, which was dubbed the "Big 
 Tent". Some people predicted it would result in the end of the world\, som
 e others expected immediate world domination\, and most were just confused
 . Where are we\, one year later ? What changes in OpenStack did the "big t
 ent" end up triggering ? What are the new challenges ahead of us ?In this 
 casual talk\, the outspoken Monty Taylor and the analytic Thierry Carrez w
 ill discuss OpenStack vision and leadership from the upstream open source 
 project side of things. Come all to learn about where we are and where we 
 plan to go.

SUMMARY:The Omniscient Cloud: Bare Metal Inspection Status Update
DTSTART:20160425T204001Z
DTEND:20160425T212021Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Ironic Inspector was introduced during the Kilo cycle (under t
 he name of ironic-discoverd) to allow inspection of hardware properties re
 quired for Ironic. Since then\, weve found even more uses for deep inspect
 ion of hardware served by Ironic.This session gives a quick introduction i
 nto Ironic Inspector\, its role in bare metal provisioning and Ironic Insp
 ector's pluggable architecture\, and how it provides smarter processing of
  the inspection data.Youll also learn about extended features introduced i
 n the Liberty and Kilo cycles\, such as inspection rules\, support for Iro
 nic Python Agent\, and plug-in hooks for interaction with CMDBs. The sessi
 on will conclude with future plans\, including node auto-discovery and hig
 h-availability.

SUMMARY:Nova Cells V2: What's Going On?
DTSTART:20160425T204001Z
DTEND:20160425T212041Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Nova cells is an optional deployment architecture that allows 
 for scaling to thousands of compute nodes within a single region. It is in
  use by large deployers such as Rackspace\, CERN\, GoDaddy\, and others. H
 owever because it is not the default architecture\, lacks support for some
  major features like security groups\, and is not well understood by most 
 developers it does not receive the same level of testing and scrutiny as o
 ther parts of Nova and is considered experimental. The cells version 2 eff
 ort aims to change that. Under version 2 all Nova features will be support
 ed and the default deployment will be using cells.This talk will describe 
 what work is taking place to get there\, what all deployers need to know a
 bout the upgrade process that will be required\, and what is coming in the
  future.

SUMMARY:Deep Dive into Neutron Upgrade Story
DTSTART:20160425T214000Z
DTEND:20160425T222000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Everyone agrees that cloud upgrades needs to be smooth\, quick
  and reliable\, with no downtime on data nor control plane. From the techn
 ical point of view this is a big challenge\, especially for Neutron which 
 is well known as one of the most complex project in OpenStack. In Mitaka\
 , a dedicated Neutron Upgrades team was established to track and push forw
 ard upgrade items. In this session we will show why it's important for dev
 elopers and operators to understand all kinds of upgrade process implicati
 ons to keep their users happy. We'll cover what was achieved by the Neutro
 n Upgrades team in Liberty and Mitaka cycles\, starting from agent side wo
 rk to the latest and greatest object versioning pieces that pave the way t
 o more reliable rolling upgrades. We'll explain the challenges that we had
  to face and the solutions we have found so that other projects can learn 
 from our trials and mistakes. Finally we will list what's currently being
  worked on and we'll glimpse rolling upgrades roadmap.

SUMMARY:Tempest Stable Interfaces for OpenStack Integration Testing
DTSTART:20160425T223019Z
DTEND:20160425T231059Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:The aim of Tempest has been from the start to provide a set of
  integration test for OpenStack\; however Tempest scope have evolved in ti
 me: itused to be mostly targeted todevstack - now it is ran against OpenSt
 ack production deployment as well - often to validate interoperability as 
 defined by DefCore. Tempest used to encompass tests for all of the OpenSta
 ck projects\; since the Big Tent was introduced\, it aims to cover only si
 x core services\, and it exposes external interfaces for all other project
 s. These changes have caused the code base to grow rather organically whil
 e it adapted to the new needs.During the Liberty and Mitaka cycle we have 
 defined stable interfaces in Tempest\, so that maintainers of OpenStack pr
 ojects may produce integration tests in a "Tempest plugin.This talk will c
 over the work which has been done on Tempest and Tempest-Lib to define sta
 ble interfaces. It will also provide examples on how to consume them to pr
 oduce a plugin for Tempest.
