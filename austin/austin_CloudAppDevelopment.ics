DESCRIPTION:One of the challenges that users face when developing an appli
 cation using a microservices architecture is how to distribute information
  between each microservice. Similar challenges can be seen in IoT and sens
 or applications - how can you efficiently receive data from huge numbers o
 f devices? For the purpose of our presentation we developed a demo on reso
 lving these communication and distribution problems using Zaqar\, OpenStac
 ks Messaging and Notification service.

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack Horizon\, command-line clients and API libraries let
  developers and operators interact directly\, indirectly\, and automatical
 ly with a target cloud. Analytics tools like Stacklight (LMA toolchain) gi
 ve deeper insight with sophisticated interactive graphics and out-of-band 
 interaction channels like Nagios alerts. Beyond these tools\, however\, li
 es a new world of VR-based immersive UX for operations\, visualization and
  collaboration.In this session\, we’ll discuss:Open-source toolchain opt

DESCRIPTION:Engage and enable enterprise development teams to realize the 
 value from cloud architecture and accelerate cloud application while enabl
 ing solutions that work on any client platform. In this session we will pr
 ovide an overview of how to design applications for the cloud and provide 
 lessons learned from a customer who has 800+ applications in various stage
 s of development and deployment. The session will cover architecture desig
 n decisions\, key things to consider for integration with existing applica
 tion\, design patterns\, code samples\, and best practices for developing 
 cloud aware applications and supporting business strategy for modern appli
 cation development (cloud\, mobile/multi-OS\, application security\, and i
 mproved user experience).Deploying a cloud infrastructure is only the firs
 t step in realizing the business value. Engaging the application developme
 nt teams is critical with solutions that address the business problems ent
 erprisesare facing with security\, multiple client platform support\, and 
 cloud integration. Within Intel IT ouroriginal cloud specific approach sta
 lled our cloud adoption for almost 2 years\, first issue centered on theap
 plication architecture and the second primarily because of integration wit
 h existing solutions andservices. We will share the challenges and approac
 hes\, development practices and technologies used toaccelerate modern appl
 ication solutions and cloud deployment.

DESCRIPTION:Building a cloud orchestrator is not like building any other c
 loud application.  Not because it is more challenging\, they’re all cha
 llenging...but because an orchestrator needs to expose the full range of f
 unctionality that the underlying cloud exposes.If the orchestrator can't p
 rovide the full range of cloud services\, such as how to manage versionin
 g dependencies\, how to do unit\, integration and system tests - just to n
 ame a few\, what good is it ultimately?That is why integrating with the cl
 oud SDK correctly\, while taking into account important aspects around ide
 m-potency\, dealing with errors\, and even dealing with specific cloud qui
 rks\, requires users to have access to the full range of API functions and
  parameters through the orchestration template.  In this talk we’ll des
 cribe the techniques we used to expose the full OpenStack SDK to Cloudify 
 blueprints\, some of the pitfalls encountered\, and how we overcame them.

DTEND:20160427T173040Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Hybrid Clouds are becoming more and more popular\, and so grow
 s the need to orchestrate the applications across the clouds: multi-tier a
 pps may require to put their backends on the private clouds while having f
 rontends at public ones\, some others may deploy identical copies of thems
 elves in different clouds for better fault tolerance\, and so on. Designin
 g such hybrids is complicated\, and orchestrating them in cross-cloud envi
 ronments is even harder. There is a number of mostly commercial third-part
 y solutions trying to build a universal orchestrator\, all having their ow
 n pros and cons.Luckily there is no need to add any extra orchestrator whe
 n you are building your hybrid solution with OpenStack as one of the parts
 \, since it already has Murano: a mature Openstack project providing power
 ful framework to build\, catalog and deploy applications in the cloud. Now
  it is capable to orchestrate applications not only in Openstack clouds\, 
 but other clouds as well - so let's learn how to do it.

DESCRIPTION:In order to drive efforts in the App Ecosystem Working Group t
 o make OpenStack more efficient for application developers\, it is necessa
 ry first to take a look on the current app development experience in OpenS
 tack.This analysis was conducted through a Cloud Benchmarking where OpenSt
 ack was compared against major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services
 \, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. The goal was to discover bes
 t practices\, gaps and critical issues in application development process 
 in OpenStack (using Rackspace and OVH as providers) against the most popul
 ar public clouds.The Cloud Benchmarking contains the findings classified i
 n best practices\, gaps and critical issues. These findings are grouped in
  the stages of the development life cycle which are sign up\, infrastructu
 re setup\, development\, deployment\, updates\, monitoring and resources c
 lean up.Session Video Abstract:To make OpenStack more efficient for applic
 ation developers\, the App Ecosystem WG studied the current development ex
 perience in OpenStack by conducting cloud benchmarking analysis. Through t
 his analysis\, the group compared OpenStack against major cloud providers 
 such as Amazon Web Services\, Microsoft Azure\, and Google Cloud Platform\
 , seeking to discover best practices\, gaps and critical issues in the app
 lication development process in OpenStack.

SUMMARY:Open Infrastructure Means ANY Infrastructure - Hybrid DevOps on an
 d Beyond OpenStack [With Demo]

DESCRIPTION:DefCore works toward Interop within the OpenStack community 
 BUT most users face larger Interop challenge: working across multiple diff
 erent platforms. We can fix that problem with hybrid devops that abstracts
  cloud variation.Just like we build open clouds using gear from multiple h
 ardware vendors\, we can build open infrastructure by using infrastructure
  from OpenStack\, raw metal and proprietary cloud providers.  Making work
 loads portable between vendors gives control back to the users and drives 
 open innovation.This presentation talks about how we can make this vision 
 a reality using open source tools and operational processes.  We'll demo 
 moving a container management platform (Swarm or Kubernetes) from non-Open
 Stack clouds on to the OpenStack platform.  User choice is the heart of o
 pen platforms and innovation\, let's break cloud lock-in together.

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack is a tool\, and tools are meant to do one thing well
 . Unfortunately\, people often use a tool improperly ("Get me a bigger ham
 mer!"). The correct workload for OpenStack is an application that follows 
 the 12 Factor App methodology. We will discuss this methodology and how Op
 enStack assists in adhering to it.We will:Explain the 12 Factor App method
 ologyDiscuss how the 12 Factor App and OpenStack compliment each otherHow 
 how adopting the 12 Factor App and OpenStack enhances agilityThis session 
 discusses a specific solution that can be used by organizations to increas
 e agility. It is a how to\, not a philosophical discussion

DESCRIPTION:Horizon is the default WebUI for OpenStack clouds but sometime
 s there is a need for customization to include features such as approval w
 orkflows\, application catalogs for self-service\, or simply the need to a
 dd your company logo.OpenStack clouds\, by design\, provide a set of rich 
 RESTful APIs which can be leveraged to build your own portal.  In a custo
 m portal\, it is also possible to leverage RESTful APIs from other service
 s in your organization to build a holistic control plane for your entire I
 T environment!In this talk\, we will discuss/demonstrate how to create an 
 IT infrastructure web portal based on OpenStack APIs and also incorporate 
 capabilities exposed by automation tools such as Chef or ServerSpec.

DESCRIPTION:Continuous integration and continuous delivery are important a
 spects in today's agile and iterative application development methods. Sys
 tems such as Jenkins have become pillars of the continuous integration mov
 ement providing a general framework to run application-specific tests. On 
 the other hand\, continuous delivery has always remained as a challenge. T
 his is especially true if the deployment target is an OpenStack environmen
 t which involves several moving parts. In this talk we will present a CI/C
 D solution that we have built using Jenkins for CI and OpenStack Solum for
  CD for testing and deploying applications to OpenStack clouds.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Now you got baremetal servers\, virtual machines and even cont
 ainers but an application developer has to know a lot about infrastructure
  specifics to meet his application SLAs. It actually become worst since no
 w you (as a developer) must know about VM flavors\, anti-affinity rules\, 
 servers specifications (e.g. spinning disks vs. SSD) and availability zone
 s  Wasnt it better when someone was taking care of this and you could focu
 s on developing your application? No worries\, it will take some work\, bu
 t there is light at the end of the tunnel.Application SLAs define the expe
 cted behavior of the infrastructure to provide capabilities needed for the
  application to deliver value in the planned/expected fashion. These SLAs 
 can be defined as a set of complex policies that identify conditions to be
  met in the infrastructure\, these can be as simple as memory availability
  to complex one based on historical data or patterns.

DESCRIPTION:This presentation will start by introducing basic concepts in 
 using Heat with Load Balancer As A Service (LBaaS) v2. Have you been wonde
 ring whether to use LBaaS v1 or LBaaS v2 especially if you are using Heat?
  This session will help you get a good understanding of the advantages of 
 LBaaS v2 and some of the reasons on why you should not mix and match LBaaS
  v1 and LBaaS v2.We will cover fundamental differences between LBaaS v1 an
 d LBaaS v2 from a Heat perspective\; discuss the Heat resource hierarchy a
 nd dive into the depths of the resource properties and attributes.Want to 
 see it in action? We will make the learning practical by showing Heat temp
 late examples for LBaaS v2.

DTEND:20160428T200040Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Although there are variety of PaaS\, enterprises require finer
  granularity and adaptability of development and deployment methodologies 
 to existing practices and tools. Mesos\, Kubernetes\, etc. although popula
 r still is IaaS albeit at a higher level of abstraction.We'll take a fairl
 y minimal openstack install and build a platform on top of it using standa
 rd open source tooling like Docker\, Deis\, etc.We will then take you thro
 ugh the application lifecycle of a cloud native application showing you ho
 w to use CI/CDon top of that platform and all you have to care about is yo
 ur development workflow against github.We will provide an environment with
  some tools integrated\, requiring attendees to work on simple exercises a
 nd complement the platform with other tools and tofollow the methodologies
  of continuous deployment.Once this is done\, it can greatly simplify the 
 development and deployment of applications and greatly reduce the time it 
 takes to take a feature from idea to product.
