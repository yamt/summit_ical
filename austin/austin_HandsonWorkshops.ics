DESCRIPTION:RSVP required.Health/status monitoring and metrics processing/
 visualization at cloud-scale present significant new challenges for public
  and private clouds. Monasca is a multi-tenant\, highly scalable\, perform
 ant\, fault-tolerant\, monitoring-as-a-service solution for OpenStack that
  supports storing and querying metrics\, alarming/thresholding\, and notif
 ications. Support for real-time event streaming and logging is in progress
 . See\,https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Monasca.This hands-on tutorial feat
 ures sessions on the following topics:Introduction to the Monasca Architec
 tureUsing the Monasca Horizon Dashboard and GrafanaThe Monasca REST APIThe
  Monasca Python ClientDeploying Monasca and TroubleshootingOverview of the
  Monasca AgentEffectively Monitoring OpenStack using MonascaWhat's new and
  what's next for Monasca?Attendees will download and use Monasca on their

SUMMARY:Configure Your Cloud for Auto-Recovery

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:RSVP required.All technology fails. There is no getting around
  this point. The part that we can influence out of that statement is what 
 happens when the technology fails. OpenStack in all its marvelous modular 
 glory can be a bear when you encounter the service failure creep. You know
  that thinkg which occurs when one service fails and then causes another s
 ervice to fail...then on and on.Imagine if you could configure your OpenSt
 ack services to automatically recovery. Yes\, I know you are going to say 
 I can do that with a cron job or something alike. For a second think of th
 e impact if you could link your monitoring system to another one that will
  trigger automated recovery processes to restore your OpenStack services w
 ithout human intervention.This workshop will walk attendess thru the proce
 ss of linking a monitoring system such as Nagios to an automated recovery 
 system such as StackStorm to produce auto-recovery OpenStack cloud actions

DESCRIPTION:RSVP required.Selling the services provided by a Cloud is one 
 of the essential aspect of the life of a Cloud Provider (both Public or Pr
 ivate). Thus being able to define the various prices and policies that nee
 ds to be apply needs to be done using some components at the root of the i
 nfrastructure.In this workshop you'll have the chance to learn how access 
 the new way to handle metrics in an OpenStack Cloud but also to use them f
 or your pricing rules. and ONLY using some official components !This hands

DESCRIPTION:RSVP required.Swift is an object storage system designed for d
 ata that needs to be instantly accessible from any device and stored forev
 er. In short\, it is the engine that runs some of the biggest storage clou
 ds on the planet. This workshop will cover Swift’s architecture\, its te
 chnology capabilities\, and real-world infrastructure-as-a-service use cas
 es. In the workshop\, each attendee will participate in a hand-on lab depl
 oying a Swift cluster in a virtual environment\, so bring your laptop!Prio
 r to the workshop\, be sure that you have a terminal appliction installed 
 on your laptop (e.g. Window = Putty\, Mac / Linux = Terminal). This OpenSt
 ack Swift introduction is great for attendees who want to understand the d
 esign goals of Swift and how they can best make use of this OpenStack comp
 onent. It will be an informative experential introduction for those intere
 sted in running Swift or contributing to the Swift project.

SUMMARY:Building Distributed Systems with CoreOS 
DTSTART:20160426T161500Z
DTEND:20160426T174500Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Building distributed systems is hard\, but with the right comp
 onents just about anyone can get started. At the heart of any distributed 
 system is the underlying infrastructure\, which often includes a collectio
 n of servers\, a central configuration and lock service\, and a scheduler 
 to manage your workloads.CoreOS provides all of these components starting 
 with the base OS\, CoreOS Linux\; a minimal OS optimized for running Linux
  containers. Next is the central key value store\, etcd\, which provides s
 hared configuration\, service discovery\, and a cluster wide lock service 
 built on top of the Raft consensus algorithm for high-availability. These 
 components mixed with Kubernetes provides ways for you to scale your workl
 oads\, similar to how Google\, Twitter and Facebook do today.All of these 
 projects are open source and part of growing community. Come learn how to 
 get started with CoreOS today.

DESCRIPTION:RSVP required.Neutron is deployed in the majority of OpenStack
  clouds but it still constitutes one of the key areas of concerns for orga
 nizations world-wide. The transition from traditional hardware-centric net
 working to the software defined model takes time and learning and requires
  a mental shift as well as a change in workflows\, procedures\, tools and 
 best-practices. In this session each participant will be provided with a p
 ersonal sandbox OpenStack running a live Liberty-based environment and wil
 l work on common use cases and applications of SDNs in an OpenStack Cloud.
  The class will focus on test cases that will move beyond the basics of L2
  and L3 and deploy VNFs such as NAT and security policies on top of a 3-ti
 er application topology. The class will also go through exercises that are
  focused on monitoring and troubleshooting SDNs in an OpenStack cloud.

DESCRIPTION:RSVP required.A microservices software architecture is as an a
 pproach to developing a single application as a suite of small services\, 
 each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechani
 sms\, often an HTTP resource API. These services are independently deploya
 ble and scalable by fully automated deployment machinery and each service 
 provides a firm module boundary with a minimum of centralized management. 
 You’ve heard enough\, and you are so ready to give this architecture a t
 ry\, right? This hands-on lab will show you how to build it and will walk
  you through step-by-step deployment of Kubernetes\, Docker\, Flannel and 
 etcd on OpenStack to get you started.Please bring a laptop with a web bro

 now how to use shell.In this session you will learn how to configure OpenS
 tack Magnum\, how to manage VM clusters (Bays) which can host containers (
 Docker for now)\, and how to connect to container orchestration tools (we 
 will use Kubernetes) to manage containers. We will go through what is supp

 tainer world\, how to operate Magnum CLI\, and how you might employ it for
  your application._________________________________________________Please 
 bring your laptop with at least 6GB of free RAM and at least 2 core i5 CPU
 . In theory\, any OS will work. Also\, to save a lot of time for you and o

DESCRIPTION:RSVP required.Roll up your sleeves  build Docker-based web ser
 vices through the OpenStack Orchestration framework. Docker provides a qui
 ck and consistent way to containerize your applications\, making them perf
 ect for deploying on a cloud platform. OpenStack provides an orchestration
  framework\, the Heat project\, to allow end-users to quickly and easily d
 eploy complex services in a consistent\, scalable manner. By combining the
  two\, you now have a powerful tool to help you conquer the world. These f
 rameworks can be intimidating\, however\, and many users stay away because
  they're uncomfortable being responsible for instigating such a severe cha
 nge in the way their company deploys. In this session\, we will introduce 
 the basic concepts of OpenStack Orchestration and Docker\, and provide han
 ds-on experience to help demystify the process and get to that comfort lev
 el. **Note** Attendees will need their own laptop to connect to our local
