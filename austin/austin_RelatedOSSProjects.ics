SUMMARY:Project Vitrage: How to Organize\, Analyze and Visualize your Open
 Stack Cloud

DESCRIPTION:When problems or strange behaviors emerge in a complexcloud en
 vironment\, it's difficult to understand what is causing them\, making the
  management of such systems untenable.The Vitrage project is designedto ad
 dress precisely this.Vitrage is a new Root Cause Analysis Engine for organ
 izing\, analyzing and expanding OpenStack alarms  events\, yielding insigh
 ts regarding the root cause of problems and deducing the existence of prob
 lems before they are directly detected.Its ultimate goal is that every sig
 nificant occurrence in the cloud should have a timely alarm generated for 
 it\, and that the cause-effect relationships between these events is under
 stood and visualized.In this session we'll present Vitrage for the first t
 ime. In addition to going over its goals\, design and planned features\, w
 e will demo three features supported for the Mitaka version of Vitrage:1.

SUMMARY:Quantifying the Noisy Neighbor Problem in Openstack
DTSTART:20160428T145000Z
DTEND:20160428T153040Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Two of the desirable features for private clouds are better co
 ntrol and predictable performance. Although public clouds have been extens
 ively researched to characterize their unpredictable performance\, private
  clouds have received less scrutiny.In this talk\, we will present how pro
 duction workloads interfere with each other in an Openstack based cloud. W
 e draw lessons from a several month long study of running workloads in dif
 ferent configurations on highly available implementation of Openstack. We 
 study the impact of noisy neighbors on the network and storage IO performa
 nce of applications. We also look at the performance metrics of Openstack 
 control plane and how the API calls are impacted with more number of entit
 ies like networks\, routers\, VMs\, volumes. Our study relies on a tool th
 at we developed to create clean and noisy workload deployments\, using mic
 ro-benchmarks as well as enterprise workloads such as Hadoop\, Jenkins and
  Redis.

SUMMARY:Cephfs in Jewel: Stable at Last
DTSTART:20160428T160019Z
DTEND:20160428T164059Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:The Ceph upstream community is declaring CephFS stable for the
  first time in the recent Jewel release\, but that declaration comes with 
 caveats: while we have filesystem repair tools and a horizontally scalable
  POSIX filesystem\, we have default-disabled exciting features like horizo
 ntally-scalable metadata servers and snapshots. This talk will present exa
 ctly what features you can expect to see\, what's blocking the inclusion o
 f other features\, and what you as a user can expect and can contribute by
  deploying or testing CephFS.

SUMMARY:Multi-unit OpenStack Cloud Deployment Using LXD Containers On Your
  Laptop

DTEND:20160428T173040Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Testing OpenStack deployments without having access to multipl
 e pieces of physical server infrastructure can be challenging\;  Find out
  how to use LXD (the container hypervisor for Linux) with Juju (the servic
 e modelling tool from Canonical) to deploy OpenStack in LXC containers on 
 your laptop\, simulating a real world multi-node deployment with Open vSwi
 tch overlay networking and running KVM instances without the overhead of n
 ested virtualization.

SUMMARY:Speeding up Developer Productivity with OpenStack and Open Source 
 Tools
DTSTART:20160428T183019Z
DTEND:20160428T191059Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:OpenStacks orchestration service and APIs enable developers to
  easily deploy application infrastructure themselvesbut what if developers
  want to use the popular open source tools with which they're already fami
 liar?This talk covers how developers can use tools from HashiCorp (Vagrant
 \, Terraform\, Packer)\, Docker\, Ansible\, Puppet\, and others to quickly
  provision workloads on OpenStack clouds. The presenters will share practi
 cal examples that attendees can follow along with at the talk and/or take 
 back home to try in their own labs.

SUMMARY:Watcher\, a Resource Manager for OpenStack: Plans for the N-releas
 e and Beyond
DTSTART:20160428T192000Z
DTEND:20160428T200000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Watcher is an open source software package which provides a fl
 exible and scalable resource optimization service for multi-tenant OpenSta
 ck-based clouds. Watcher provides a complete optimization loop—including
  everything from a metrics receiver\, optimization processor andan action 
 plan applier. This provides a robust framework to realize a wide range of 
 cloud optimization goals\, including the reduction of data center operatin
 g costs\, increased system performance via intelligent virtual machine mig
 ration\,increased energy efficiency\, etc. The overall goal is that OpenSt
 ack-based clouds equipped with Watcher will decrease their Total Cost of O
 wnership by way of more efficient use of their infrastructure through targ
 eted optimizations and close-loop automation. In this talk we will go over
  the state of Watcher as it is today\, its architecture\, the team’s acc
 omplishments for the Mitaka release and our plans for the N-release and be
 yond.

SUMMARY:Infrastructure as Code in OpenStack with Ansible - Advanced Neutro
 n Use Cases
DTSTART:20160428T201001Z
DTEND:20160428T205041Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:This session will explore the step by step approach to deploy 
 4 popular use cases configuring advanced Neutron1) Deploy a Load Balanced 
 2 tier infrastructure (Using Oracle and Tomcat) that leverages LBaaS v2. 
  How to perform proactive autoscaling by code - and bypassing the LBaaS v2
  lack of integration with Heat / Ceilometer.2) FWaaS use case to block by 
 code certain ports in our two tier infrastructure while allowing your end 
 users to still reach the core services.3) Configure a VPNaaS across two se
 parate OpenStack clouds.In this use case our web services are running in o
 ne OpenStack cloud (could be a public cloud) while our database services a
 re running safely on premise in a separate private cloud. VPNaaS will allo
 w the comminication between Tomcat in our "public" cloud and Oracle in our
  "private" cloud.  This is transparent to the end user.4) Baremetal provi
 sioning with Ansible playbooks:  A quick demo to showcase the configurati
 on management capabilities of Ansible on Baremetal.

SUMMARY:Improving Cloud Performance with GCC Latest Technologies in Clear 
 Linux Project
DTSTART:20160428T211001Z
DTEND:20160428T215021Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:As the  Linux community continues to redefine the boundaries 
 of what is possible in a cloud-based Linux distributions running on Intel 
 silicon\, both power and performance play an increasingly important role i
 n the industry. In the Clear Linux Project for Intel Architecture\, we dec
 ided to use the latest GCC technology to boost the performance of a cloud-
 based system. From profile-based techniques (PGO and AutoFDO) to Function 
 Multi-Versioning (compiler feature that is capable of optimizing the same 
 code for multiple architectures and then automatically selecting the corre
 ct architecture-specific version of the code at runtime) we will show how 
 these technologies  can be used to improve runtime performance and unleas
 h the power of IA in  Linux distributions. This presentation will help th
 e cloud developers to better understand the capabilities of the latest ver
 sion of GCC compiler. This will include demos and open source templates th
 at can be reused for their own applications.
