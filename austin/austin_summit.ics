 penstackfoundation.formstack.com/forms/mentoringUpstream University is an 
 intensive program designed to help new contributors learn how to effective
 ly work upstream\, by fixing bugs and getting their features accepted into
  the OpenStack project. The educational program requires students to work 
 on real-life bug fixes or new features during two days of real-life classe
 s and online mentoring\, until the work is accepted by OpenStack. The live
  two-day class teaches them to navigate the intricacies of the projects te
 chnical tools and social interactions. In a followup session\, the student
 s benefit from individual online sessions to help them resolve any remaini
 ng problems they might have.Make sure to book your travel plans to arrive 
 in Austin Friday evening or Saturday morning in order to attend the full t
 wo-day training session.

SUMMARY:Command Presence Workshop\, Organized by the Women of OpenStack
DTSTART:20160424T170000Z

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:RSVP Required.The Command Presence Workshop has been recogniz
 ed by the Anita Borg Institute and Harvard Business Review.  It is intend
 ed to teach participants how to handle “senior-level high pressure meeti
 ngs”.  The majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address
  a simulated\, but very realistic crisis event.  In the class\, each part
 icipant assumes a role\, and is given about 30minutes to prepare 1-2 slide
 s.  Once the class has prepared\, the simulation begins.  There is a rol
 e-play simulation. It is not uncommon to hear occasional “gasps” of di
 sbelief from the participants.  The workshop participants will experience
  rapid-fire questioning\, interruption\, and other situations that occur i
 n senior-level meetings\, but in a safe environment conducive to learning 
 techniques for handling such situations. Facilitators: Ruchi Bhargava (In
 tel)\, Malini Bhandaru (Intel) and a panel of leaders representative of 
 the OpenStack leadership in the community (business leaders and technical
  leaders).

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:RSVP Required. Breakfast and coffee will be provided.Update:
  At this time we are full for mentors for this event! If you want to sign
  up as a mentor\, we can put you on a waiting list. Or\, you could sign up
  as a mentee instead and maybe meet someone with expertise in a different 
 area.In addition to the RSVP link below please also complete the general m
 entoring questionnaire here - https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/fo
 rms/mentoring.This is like speed dating\, where mentees will have five-to-
 10 minutes to talk to potential mentors\, then cycle throughout the room 
 for about an hour-and-a-half. At the end\, people will fill out surveys w
 ith their preferences and we'll contact people about potential matches. 
 We're hoping to do this at the beginning of the Summit\, so hopefully men
 tors and mentees can have some face to face time throughout the week.The n
 ew mentoring program sponsored the Women of OpenStack is designed to be a
  lightweight mentoring initiative to provide technical or career guidance
  to beginners in the community.  Mentees should already be part of the co
 mmunity\; they should have gone through\, or be familiar with the Upstrea
 m Training.Technical mentoring doesn't just mean coding\, we're looking f
 or people who are a specialist in any area of OpenStack - for example doc
 s or marketing.  Technical mentors and mentees should expect to spend ab
 out an hour a week talking about projects to get involved in\, people to
  meet\, anything to help their mentees get to their next step. Career me
 ntors could be in a completely different area of OpenStack from their men
 tees.  They should expect to spend about an hour a month with their ment
 ees offering more general career guidance\, maybe helping their mentees m
 ake connections in the community.

DESCRIPTION: The OpenStack community currently has several ways to track 
 requirements and implementation at the project level from blueprints to sp
 ecs to Gerrit\, however it is still fairly difficult to track cross projec
 t needs and user stories (concepts) that require work across multiple proj
 ects and\, potentially\, multiple releases.   In this session\, we will c
 over a need for greater visibility from the Product WG that aligns well wi
 th the general cross-project development tracking needs in the community w
 hich resulted in our project to create a cross-project user story dashboar
 d.   We have started working on a prototype and would be glad to receive 
 feedback\, and assistance\, from the OpenStack development community!  Th
 e session will conclude with a demonstration of our progress thus far.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:RefStack was recently adopted by DefCore as the official test 
 result collection tool that vendors\, operators\, and users can report int
 eroperability test results to. So far many companies have already got thei
 r OpenStack solution certified through RefStack. To apply for OpenStack tr
 ademark licensing programs\, you will need to run Tempest inside of the Re
 fStack Client\, and upload the results to the RefStack Server. Once your r
 esults are uploaded\, you can send a link to the report page to interop@op
 enstack.org.After giving a brief introduction to RefStack\, in this talk\,
  we will discuss the newly implemented features such as:Uploading data as 
 a validated userInterpreting test results per DefCore GuidelinesAssociatin
 g a test run to a specific DefCore Guideline and Target programAssociating
  test results to a product/vendorWe also share what features are in store 
 for RefStack along with some troubleshooting techniques based on the lesso

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:The OpenStack gate operates at a tremendous scale there are hu
 ndreds gate jobs run in a single day. It is impossible for anyone to track
  by hand. This is why a lot of tooling has been developed or leveraged to 
 help make sense of things. However\, with all this tooling there is still 
 a complexity problem with the number of tools available.Late in Liberty op
 enstack-health was created\, the goal is to be the first stop for anyone t
 hat is looking at test results can go. It leverages other tools when appro
 priate to try and be a starting point. It is also hosted on the community 
 infrastructure and continuously deployed using the community development i
 nfrastructure.This talk will explain the openstack-health dashboard\, how 
 it works\, it's current limitations\, and the future of the project. It'll
  also cover some related tools that are available and how they all fit tog
 ether\, and how you can use everything together to take a more data driven
  approach to analyze and test OpenStack with the gate.

DTEND:20160425T165559Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Hierarchical multitenancy is available since Kilo and enables 
 a better resource management by creating projects and subprojects in a hie
 rarchical fashion. Among other benefits\, quota management and access cont
 rol are simplified by the use of roles that are inheritable for lower leve
 ls of the hierarchy and this reflects more accurately the responsibilities
  and resource sharing in an organization.Another improvement that we’ve 
 made is the addition of projects acting as domains\, where now\, projects 
 are not only the container of other services’ resources\, but also conta
 in users and other projects\, that once belonged to domains.In this talk\,
  we will present the recently incorporated features\, in which projects co
 uld mirror the real hierarchical structure of organizations and ease resou
 rce management and access control by cloud administrators and how using pr
 ojects acting as domains can make the life of the cloud administrator easi
 er.

DESCRIPTION:More and more enterprises are looking at how to bring agile in
 frastructure to their application developers\, providing developers the to
 ols they need to create\, deploy and iterate apps faster. But in the real 
 world\, there are practical limitations like SLA obligations\, latency iss
 ues\, and resource capacity. These demand caution when moving to agile inf

  Travis Newhouse\, Chief Architect at AppFormix\, will talk about the pitf
 alls and challenges of operating agile infrastructure for enterprise users
  with practical considerations like those mentioned above. They’ll share
  experiences from enterprises\, such as ViaSat\, a global provider of sate
 llite broadband and wireless services\, infrastructure\, and technology. 
 You’ll learn why enterprises are taking the agile journey\, what issues 
 they encounter along the way\, and how OpenStack helps to deliver a self-s

DESCRIPTION:Overstock.com recently made the big leap from nova-network to 
 Neutron networking in order to increase network resiliency and reduce fail
 over time. We also chose to use the MidoNet Neutron plugin.The results hav
 e been fantastic!It used to be that moving 100 networks from the active no
 va-network node to the passive one resulted in network downtime for fiftee
 n long\, finger-crossing\, pit-sweating minutes for us. Now that we have f
 ully distributed\, active/active network gateways\, there is no failover. 
 We now perform maintenance and reboots on our gateways and controllers in 
 the middle of the day and our users do not feel it. We also gained full vi
 sibility into all of our network flows within our clouds!As an extra bonus
 \, we now get to sit at the cool kids' table and throw around neat buzz-wo

DESCRIPTION:One of the primary requirements of an enterprise customer host
 ed on a private cloud is guaranteed availability of their workload. Althou
 gh Openstack natively supports some forms of HA\, there is a big gap from 
 the enterprise perspective.Specifically the gaps are if a compute node goe
 s down\, the VMs have to be manually evacuated. With most platforms having
  Predictive failure detection mechanisms\, there is no way to live-migrate
  VMs to healthier nodes either.This proposal addresses these gaps thru dev
 eloping a HA framework that is both ReActive and ProActive.With reactive H
 A\, we will show how the VMs running on a compute node which goes down\, c
 an automatically be restored.With proactive HA\, we will show how the fram
 ework triggers Live Migrations in case of high thermal signature\, predict
 ive hardware failures\, host maintenance mode\, slow application performan
 ce due to bottlenecks\, and other custom triggers (ceilometer alarms\, zab
 bix)thus mitigating VM down-time for enterprise workloads

 o.Messaging has improved quire a bit\, especially with the implementation 
 of a couple of new drivers. The problem is that weve learned that the way 
 Oslo.Messaging has been implemented is less than optimal. Since it impacts

 uch too soon. Topics will include Active Directory\, DR\, integrating with

 domains\, administrators can define policies at a centralized location and
  use IO Visor technology for distributed enforcement. This provides infras
 tructure independent rules\, template-based policy definitions\, and scale

 ervices. This session will be presented by members of the IO Visor communi

DESCRIPTION:Everyone agrees that cloud upgrades needs to be smooth\, quick
  and reliable\, with no downtime on data nor control plane. From the techn
 ical point of view this is a big challenge\, especially for Neutron which 
 is well known as one of the most complex project in OpenStack. In Mitaka\
 , a dedicated Neutron Upgrades team was established to track and push forw
 ard upgrade items. In this session we will show why it's important for dev
 elopers and operators to understand all kinds of upgrade process implicati
 ons to keep their users happy. We'll cover what was achieved by the Neutro
 n Upgrades team in Liberty and Mitaka cycles\, starting from agent side wo
 rk to the latest and greatest object versioning pieces that pave the way t
 o more reliable rolling upgrades. We'll explain the challenges that we had
  to face and the solutions we have found so that other projects can learn 
 from our trials and mistakes. Finally we will list what's currently being
  worked on and we'll glimpse rolling upgrades roadmap.

DESCRIPTION:Academics and industry experts are advocating for going from l

 such a model\, the development of a system in charge of turning such a com
 plex and diverse network of resources into a global Cloud is critical.In t
 his talk\, we introduce the premises of such a system. The novelty of our 
 work is that instead of developing yet another brokering solution\, we cho
 se to revise the OpenStack internals with P2P mechanisms in order to opera
 te in a distributed manner but throughout the same software platform such 
 a geographically spread Cloud. More precisely\, we describe how we extende
 d Nova with an additional driver allowing the use of a distributed key/val
 ue store instead of the centralized SQL backend. Results of experiments co
 nducted on Grid'5000 are promising and pave the way toward a first large-s

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack represents a revolution in agile and efficient publi

 cloud-native workload onto OpenStack clouds. The infrastructure supporting
  OpenStack cloud needs to be flexibly composed to run optimally for these 
 workloads.In this session\, we introduce Open Composable Network (OCN)\, a
  new way of cloud networking that stemmed from the hyper-scale cloud and w
 eb services giants\, but is being made available widely by Mellanox and ou
 r cloud ecosystem partners. Similar to Lego design\, which use basic compo
 nents with standard interfaces to construct into anything you can imagine\
 , OCN leverages network disaggregation (into basic network building blocks
 )\, open abstraction interfaces\, and automated orchestration and manageme
 nt to turn these building blocks into networks optimally composed to suppo
 rt your unique workload. This new way of cloud networking enables open pla
 tforms to unlock performance and unleash innovation to achieve web-scale e
 fficiency. Our end-to-end 25/50/100G Ethernet and InfiniBand intelligent i
 nterconnect solutions provide unparalleled speeds\, predictable performanc
 e\, and extreme flexibility to compose and recompose software-defined infr
 astructures to meet the needs of cloud-native and enterprise workloads. We

 r\, it takes a non-trivial effort to integrate pieces of technologies from
  different projects. There are many other subtle issues when users are bui

  the various events and meters you can access\; the complicated processes 
 to hook these alarms to the proper operations\; the need to watch your sc
 aling cluster for node failures\; the requirement for load-balancing...Thi

  failures. By seemlessly integrating the clustering\, telemetry\, load-bal
 ance and orchestration services\, we will show Senlin as the pivot for a

 to manage your workloads.CoreOS provides all of these components starting 
 with the base OS\, CoreOS Linux\; a minimal OS optimized for running Linux
  containers. Next is the central key value store\, etcd\, which provides s
 hared configuration\, service discovery\, and a cluster wide lock service 
 built on top of the Raft consensus algorithm for high-availability. These 
 components mixed with Kubernetes provides ways for you to scale your workl
 oads\, similar to how Google\, Twitter and Facebook do today.All of these 
 projects are open source and part of growing community. Come learn how to 
 get started with CoreOS today.

 focused on the problems of storage for OpenStack applications that create 
 and manage Petabytes of image\, video and other large unstructured data ob

 ity for applications in OpenStack environments to access storage over the 
 fast growing AWS S3 interface. This provide advantages and a wide set of a

DESCRIPTION:SAP provides a number of offerings where HANA systems are made
  available to customers in a cloud environment. In this environment\, reso
 urces are shared among numerous HANA deployments\, with secure network\, s
 torage\, and access control to ensure the confidentiality of customer data
  and operations. A custom\, in-house baremetal infrastructure lifecycle ma
 nagement solution was created in order to deploy and manage the resources 
 used to deliver these HANA landscapes in the cloud. However\, other intern
 al management systems also exist to manage different types of cloud enviro
 nments\, including virtual machines for smaller HANA systems. To consolida
 te these systems into a single infrastructure and environment\, we are beg
 inning to move from a fully in-house solution to a hybrid solution\, using
  OpenStack as a common management framework. The work presented in this do
 cument describes our approach to adopting OpenStack within our existing ba
 remetal infrastructure management solution\, which will soon be used in pr
 oduction. It should also be noted that this work will be also used to supp
 ort other baremetal infrastructure management use cases within SAP’s clo

DESCRIPTION:By now\, high availability for the OpenStack control plane is 
 well understood\, and to a large extent a solved problem which the commun
 ity continues to refine.In stark contrast\, most solutions for compute nod
 e HA (i.e. where VMs are automatically restarted on a different compute no
 de if there is a failure in the hypervisor or its underlying hardware) ar
 e still either relatively immature\, experimental\, or in the design phase
 .  This is despite the high demand for this feature\, which calls into 
 question the older belief held by some that OpenStack should only accommo
 date "cattle" VMs which have resilience built in at the application layer.
  In this talk presented by members of the OpenStack HA community who have
  been collaborating on this topic since Tokyo\, we summarise and compare a
 ll known current approaches\, from vendors including Red Hat\, SUSE\, Inte
 l\, NTT\, AWcloud\, ChinaMobile\, and ZeroStack\, and explain the current 
 thinking\, challenges presented\, and future directions.

  can contribute to make OpenStack cooperative by default.The major differe
 nce with respect to existing WGs such as the Large-Scale deployment one\, 
 is that we would like to address challenges related to the geo-distributio
 n of resources and WANwide exchanges (one single cloud/cell but deployed a
 cross multiple small sites). Concretely\, we want to study how the vanilla

DESCRIPTION:As industry is moving towards cloud\, Object Store has become 
 a choice for storage for many workloads. But\, there will continue to exis
 ts traditional applications which require data to be accessed using file a
 ccess methods like NFS/SMB. So we end up having scenarios where there are 
 applications running anywhere (VMs hosted by openstack or beyond) which ar
 e creating and accessing object data and the same object data is required 
 to be accessed by applications running on other set of VM instances via fi
 le interfaces.Manila\, the OpenStack file share service provides a way to 
 easily  securely configure a file share which can be shared between multip
 le virtual machine instances. On the other hand\, Swiftonfile diskfile imp
 lementation for OpenStack Swift allows objects to be available through fil
 e interface. Commingling these two Openstack technologies uniquely address
 es the common deployments challenged with multiprotocol access and sharing
  of same data across the VM instances.

 protection now becomes an important requirement throughout an application'
 s lifecycle. This session will cover avariety of backup and restore option
 s available for your OpenStack block and file storage. We will consider th
 e various technologies for backups within local storage\, to on-premise Sw

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack Swift is a storage project in OpenStack\, which real
 izes a highly scalable and robust object storage\, with low operational co
 st.We\, cloud storage team in NTT DATA\, have been offered many projects a
 iming to replace legacy storage to swift\, to store more data more safely 
 with lower cost. In those project\, we were often required not to change t
 he existing systems. However\, this requirement causes a problem in our in
 tegration\, when they are so "legacy" that they rarely support REST API. M
 any systems are still on the way to turning to cloud-native architectures 
 (like REST API)\, and we have seen many demands to introduce cloud system 
 into no-cloud system\, as the first step for ther turning.In this session\
 , we will explain some example cases from our Swift projects and how we so
 lved this interface problem to intergrate Swift\, very useful cloud techno
 logy\, into the existing "legacy" systems.

DESCRIPTION:For OpenStack to become the way to organisations to deploy\, m
 anage and scale applications in the next decade\, the economics need to st
 ack up. How do the economics of OpenStack compare to existing virtualisati
 on solutions or using public cloud platforms? As organisations look at the
  ever increasing options for workload and service delivery\, this talk exa
 mines the costs of OpenStack today\, how it measures up against the altern
 atives and what OpenStack users can do to improve the economics of running

 most absurd and non-sense design that an architect could even mention. Act

  your OpenStack distro of choice and get going? Well think again - nothing
  good comes that easy. Its not just about downloading some files and insta

  including how to configure\, how to install\, and most importantly how to
  maintain an administer your cloud. This is also one of the areas where th
 e OpenStack ecosystem has moved way beyond what the vanilla OpenStack code
  provides. Some of the important considerations when choosing an OpenStack
  distro are the support\, maintenance\, and management provided by the ven

DESCRIPTION:A network IPS can effectively defend your OpenStack cloud agai
 nst targeted attacks\, even at large scale\, once enabled as a virtual net
 work function (VNF).Traditional security approaches in OpenStack\, such as
  security groups and FWaaS\, lack flexibility and manageability. These sol
 utions also do not provide sophisticated active responses like running def
 ensive scripts in case of attacks\, and are not effective in protecting bi
 g enterprise clouds against sophisticated cyber attacks.A network IPS deli
 vered through Tap-as-a-Service and vRouter (enabled by the Fuel Contrail p
 lugin) as a forwarding plane can identify targeted attacks by monitoring a
 nd analyzing east-west traffic.Moreover\, we extend the architecture with 
 an open source malware sandbox (e.g. Cuckoo or PyBox) as an IPS back end t
 o identify targeted attacks (e.g. CloudAtlas and Minidionis APTs)\, and he
 lp an incident response team with a forensic investigation.We will demonst
 rate features and discuss security best practices.

DESCRIPTION:DSCP is used by large enterprises to manage network traffic in
 telligently. It provides quality of service to enable traffic engineering\
 , and in some cases can additionally be relied on to enforce network secur
 ity policies. The inclusion of DSCP in Newton Neutron now makes this facil
 ity available to all users\, from individuals to large enterprises. This t
 alk will describe DSCP for those unfamiliar with it\, discuss how DSCP is 
 used in the wild today\, and relate the path taken to deliver the Open vSw

 in mind. Now its time to start using it is designed. By deploying openstac
 k components with a microservice architecture in mind it will allow you to
  scale\, recover from disasters\, redeploy and upgrade with ease.Container

DESCRIPTION:In this presentation we will introduce a method of booting Nov
 a hypervisors over the network into a stateless live booted operating syst
 em. By using a live operating system\, we separate the stateless operating
  system running in RAM from the Nova configuration and instance data which
  is persistent on disk. Because the OS is an image\, it's easier to jump a
 cross versions as you can load the latest version of the OS by either doin
 g a reboot or a kexec. It also helps maintain consistency and ensures that
  whenever a machine goes down for maintenance or a reboot\, it will come b
 ack on the latest and greatest build. We'll touch on how the OS can be mai
 ntained using Git and how CI/CD can be utilized to automatically generate 
 the latest version of the build and deploy it.

DESCRIPTION:A new feature in development for OpenStack Swift improves secu
 rity by encrypting object data at rest.OpenStack Swift provides reliable a
 nd scalable object storage that has been deployed in many successful produ
 ction environments. The Swift developer community has recently been workin
 g on enhancing Swifts security by adding the capability to encrypt object 
 content stored on disk. Our goal is to protect data at rest from an attack
 er that gains physical access to disks. We aim to achieve this with comple
 te transparency to clients i.e. with no API changes\, other than optional 
 extensions to support client provided keys when desired.This talk will des
 cribe and demonstrate this exciting new feature\, discuss options for inte
 gration with key management services such as Barbican\, and look ahead at 
 future work to additionally encrypt account and container metadata.

DESCRIPTION:Users or operators sometimes need to run low-latency or real-t
 ime applications (such as audio/video streaming\, highly interactive syste
 ms\, etc.) to meet their requirements in clouds\, and in fact it seems tha
 t it is one of the reasons why people need to use Ironic on OpenStack\, al
 though Ironic lacks management advantage of virtualization. And a good new
 s is that we have sufficient infrastructure to achieve that in OpenStack (
 in the M release). With these features\, OpenStack can host low-latency or
  real-time applications without using Ironic. However\, its still cumberso
 me to configure and build such real-time clouds.Since we are working on Re
 al-time KVM as one of the projects of KVM enhancements for NFV at OPNFV\,

 ring\, it becomes apparent for NCI that a high performance cloud is needed
 . This cloud must combine the virtues of cloud to support multi-tenancy\, 
 self-service and Big Data type of applications\, and of HPC to support com
 pute-intensive parallel.In this presentation\, NCI and Mellanox will join 
 hands to discuss the various approaches experimented to construct a high-p
 erformance cloud\, comparison of the pros and cons of each of the approach
 es\, preliminary performance results\, and the role of high-speed network 
 for enhancing cloud performance and efficiency.

  a resilient\, persistent storage fully compliant with OpenStack Swift to 
 focus on your application without worrying about the data. Ever wonder wha

DESCRIPTION:Building a cloud orchestrator is not like building any other c

 rovide the full range of cloud services\, such as how to manage versionin
 g dependencies\, how to do unit\, integration and system tests - just to n
 ame a few\, what good is it ultimately?That is why integrating with the cl
 oud SDK correctly\, while taking into account important aspects around ide
 m-potency\, dealing with errors\, and even dealing with specific cloud qui
 rks\, requires users to have access to the full range of API functions and
  parameters through the orchestration template.  In this talk we’ll des

DESCRIPTION:The event logs are usually our best friends for determining wh

 from single node setups we have to say goodbye to finding issues with ease
  just by reading logs here and there. As the number of nodes increase\, it
  becomes painful to track the status of your deployment. Is there anything
  that might help? Yes\, central logging service. With this approach we can
  quickly get answers to “why” and “where” something went wrong\, e
 ven when malfunctioning component is offline\, and there is no way to get 
 to its local storage. But deploying a central logging service might turn o
 ut to be a little hassle itself. Luckily\, you can take advantage of Docke
 r and Ansible in Kolla\, enabling you to have a full centralized logging s

  networking benefits containers like it does virtual machines. However\, t

  nested containers inside Nova VMs require networking to work as seamlessl

DESCRIPTION:Part 1 - Software Defined Data Center and PCIe-Based Rack Scal
 e Architecture\, we will introduce two main subjects  applied research and
  development for software defined data center and rack scale architecture 
 (RSA). For the first subject\, we will highlight the enhancement we did fo
 r IOD (ITRI OpenStack Distribution)\, which includes Peregrine (Neutron Pl
 ug-in)\, DISCO (Cinder plug-in)\, HaaS and Monitoring (PDCM). Our proposal
  of RSA is based on PCIe bus for intra-rack communication to reap the bene
 fit of software defined server\, resource (NIC\, Storage\, Memory) pooling
 \, high density\, real time and low latency. This hyper-converged architec
 ture has a natural adaptation for NFV\, high end SDS and high performance 
 computing.OpenStack has emerged as a leading platform technology for build
 ing and deploying cloud computing platform and data center. At the same ti
 me\, applying big data technology/analytics solutions to address business 
 problems has caught every business executives attention. Part II - OpenSta
 ck Based Big Data Analytics Platform and Applications\, we will present ou
 r research and development work that incorporates OpenStack as a foundatio
 n layer for building a big data analytics (BDA) platform. Unlike tradition
 al big data platform that uses HDFS for file and object storage and Ambori
  for monitoring and cluster management\, our BDA platform (codename Bistro
 ) uses OpenStack for file/object storage\, cluster management among other 
 things. In addition\, we will share our experience in developing and deplo

 the time or be down less than 5.25 minutes a year. Virtualization and clo
 uds\, while promising significant advantages through agility and cost savi

DESCRIPTION:Currently cinder-volume can support multiple backends and each
  nova-compute could choose its storage backend. But glance doesn't support
  that which means we could store images in only one backend no matter how 
 many cinder drivers we used. More and more users want to leverage the adva
 ntages of ceph and enterprise storage. But with the restriction of glance 
 we could only get images in one place and copy to another storage if we bo
 ot virtual machines in different backends. After improving glance to suppo
 rt multiple storage backends\, we can use different storage resources in m
 ultiple availability zones. You can pull images from ceph and boot virtual
  machines with the COW features. At the meantime\, we're allowed to use an
 other storage pool without pulling images from ceph. This is meaningful wh
 en we're using distributed storage system and enterprise storage solution.

DESCRIPTION:Real environments are many times comprised of diverse workload
 s running on diverse infrastructure - from container and database clusters
  and even stateful services such as big data and analytics systems on bare
  metal through non-virtualized and even legacy environments. In order to c
 onnect this new wave of microservices with non-microservices - including e
 verything from setup and provisioning of networking and other complex serv
 ices on any cloud\, hybrid environment support coupled with orchestration 
 through a single pane of glass is simply imperative for such a complex ope
 ration. By fusing the TOSCA standard with best of breed open source toolin
 g and infrastructure\, Cloudify\, coupled with Riemann\, can holistically 
 orchestrate\, auto-scale\, and instrument arbitrarily diverse architecture
 s\, including but not limited to Kubernetes clusters\, Kubernetes microser
 vices\, and non-containerized services on physical and virtual infrastruct
 ure including networking (e.g. Openstack Neutron).By modeling K8S into TOS
 CA it is now possible to easily orchestrate microservices alongside non-mi
 croservices in the same template. This enables you to gather metrics for c
 ontainer images\, and trigger event-driven workflows for auto-scaling and 
 healing with Riemann - both inside and out of K8S\, and all the way throug

DESCRIPTION:Scheduling is one of the most important components of any Clou
 d deployment. Scheduling means selecting a compute layer based on user's r
 equest and taking into consideration the characteristics of the way the cl
 oud has been setup. OpenStack compute scheduling uses a filtering and weig
 hing mechanism to select a compute to schedule the instance on. Openstack 
 compute scheduling works properly when resources are available to the comp
 ute locally but it can run into various complicated problems when that is 
 not the case or when run at scale.Problems are mentioned below :Compute se
 rvice does not report a holistic view of compute resources. This makes sch
 eduling on those resources impossible.   Compute does not take into cons
 ideration resources exposed via Cinder or Neutron while scheduling.The sch
 eduler lacks global view of resources (especially relevant in heterogeneou
 s clouds).Making the scheduler aware about resource is more of a reactive 
 process than being proactive.In this talk we plan to cover all the above a
 nd many more interesting and scary horror stories about the broken state o

DESCRIPTION:Containers are fast becoming the standard unit of deployment 
 for cloud-native applications that follow the design patterns of a "Twelv
 e-Factor App". Two of those patterns talks about stateless application p
 rocesses and about backing services.  Application data that needs to pe
 rsist is typically written to a backing service such as a database and the
 se types of use-cases is where the topics of data persistence and containe
 rs meld.In this session\, we will start from the beginning by reviewing wh
 y/when containers might be a good fit with your OpenStack cloud strategy f
 ollowed by how OpenStack Cinder can be used with containers (along with ex
 amples when it shouldn't be) and\, finally\, a review of the orchestration
  tools available for leveraging persistent storage provided by OpenStack C
 inder with containers along with a demonstration.

DESCRIPTION:An exciting new feature was just added to OpenStack Neutron in
  the Mitaka release\; it's called address scopes.  Address scopes build fr
 om the subnet pools feature added in Kilo.  While subnet pools give us a m
 echanism for controlling the allocation of addresses to subnets\, address 
 scopes give Neutron a way to know where addresses are viable.  They are al
 so the thing within which addresses are not allowed to overlap.In this tal
 k\, we will give a quick review of subnet pools and then talk about how th
 ey support address scopes.  Address scopes are key to overcoming the probl
 em of "bring your own addressing" (BYOA) and are instrumental in determini
 ng where traffic should be blocked or where net address translation (NAT) 
 should be applied (or not).  This is especially important when designing y
 our cloud for IPv6.Finally\, we will briefly discuss the relationship betw
 een address scopes and two other exciting new features in Neutron:  "BGP d
 ynamic routing" and "routed networks."

DESCRIPTION:Two of the desirable features for private clouds are better co
 ntrol and predictable performance. Although public clouds have been extens
 ively researched to characterize their unpredictable performance\, private
  clouds have received less scrutiny.In this talk\, we will present how pro
 duction workloads interfere with each other in an Openstack based cloud. W
 e draw lessons from a several month long study of running workloads in dif
 ferent configurations on highly available implementation of Openstack. We 
 study the impact of noisy neighbors on the network and storage IO performa
 nce of applications. We also look at the performance metrics of Openstack 
 control plane and how the API calls are impacted with more number of entit
 ies like networks\, routers\, VMs\, volumes. Our study relies on a tool th
 at we developed to create clean and noisy workload deployments\, using mic
 ro-benchmarks as well as enterprise workloads such as Hadoop\, Jenkins and
  Redis.

DESCRIPTION:High service availability is an integral part in mobile core n

  a sub-second level fast recovery is necessary not only to ensure seamless
  connectivity to the customers\, but also to avoid the consequent attach s

 network simultaneously\, creating control traffic beyond what a node can h
 andle. In NFV-based networks\, recovery actions will be performed by a nod
 e manager which cannot directly detect virtualized network infrastructure 
 level failures. Therefore\, OpenStack needs to detect and notify the corre
 sponding node manager of relevant resource failure. An additional requirem

DESCRIPTION:FIWARE Lab is a multi-region federated Cloud\, based on OpenSt
 ack. Currently it comprises 15 regions spread all over Europe (but with a 
 presence also in LatAm). It offers a capacity of more than 3000 cores\, 10
  TB RAM\, 500 TB disk and is going to be further expanded with the additio
 n of new regions/nodes.By leveraging Ceilometer and Monasca\, we developed
  a distributed and scalable monitoring system for FIWARE Lab able to colle
 ct\, process\, analyse and finally present the relevant data to the intere
 sted users. This presentation will focus on the architecture of the soluti
 on and on how two OpenStack projects have been customized\, enhanced and d
 eployed in order to meet the expected requirements: collection of custom r
 esource metrics and sanity check measurements\, data confidentiality and d
 ata replication\, real time data vs historical aggregated data on differen
 t dimensions (time\, tenant\, “space”)\, data analytics\, unified cros
 s-region data visualization. Finally a short demo is presented.

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack is more than just a collection of services with a gr
 eat dashboard interface\, it is also a platform for building applications 
 that consume and utilize cloud resources. Combine this platform with the p
 ower of big data\, and you have a recipe for scalable\, cloud-aware\, data
  processing applications.In this talk we will follow a developer’s journ
 ey along the path of creating a real-time streaming Spark application on O
 penStack\, exploring methods for creating cloud applications. We will also
  demonstrate how to use OpenStack’s Python clients to configure message 
 queues for data ingestion\, persistent storage for processed data\, and co
 mputing nodes for large scale analytics and visualizations.Attendees shoul
 d expect to walk away from this session with an understanding of how they 
 can use OpenStack to create\, deploy\, update\, and maintain data processi
 ng applications at scale that live entirely in the cloud.

 or multiple OpenStack services. It can automatically translate the graph m
 odel to relevant OpenStack services using APIs and commands. In addition\,
  some of the policies can be given by multiple stakeholders such as tenant

DESCRIPTION:Watcher is an open source software package which provides a fl
 exible and scalable resource optimization service for multi-tenant OpenSta
 ck-based clouds. Watcher provides a complete optimization loop—including
  everything from a metrics receiver\, optimization processor andan action 
 plan applier. This provides a robust framework to realize a wide range of 
 cloud optimization goals\, including the reduction of data center operatin
 g costs\, increased system performance via intelligent virtual machine mig
 ration\,increased energy efficiency\, etc. The overall goal is that OpenSt
 ack-based clouds equipped with Watcher will decrease their Total Cost of O
 wnership by way of more efficient use of their infrastructure through targ
 eted optimizations and close-loop automation. In this talk we will go over
  the state of Watcher as it is today\, its architecture\, the team’s acc
 omplishments for the Mitaka release and our plans for the N-release and be

 ur development workflow against github.We will provide an environment with
  some tools integrated\, requiring attendees to work on simple exercises a

  of continuous deployment.Once this is done\, it can greatly simplify the 
 development and deployment of applications and greatly reduce the time it

 what it can do.The focus of this session\, ML2's "port binding"\, is the p
 rocess by which the ML2 plugin selects themechanism driver(s) and network 
 segment(s) tobe utilized for a specific Neutron port. Port binding must su
 cceed before a port will provide the requested connectivity. Its outcome c

 services to connect to the desired Neutron network. Port binding enables M
 L2 to support heterogeneous environments. Understanding how it works is cr

DESCRIPTION:The power of the community is what makes open source initiativ
 es extremely transformationallike OpenStack. On the other hand\, enterpris
 e users who are looking at adopting this solution need to go through a ste
 ep learning curve and deep transformation of their internal team structure
 . The power of OpenStack is actually greatly amplified by the ecosystem of
  vendors around it that look at important aspects like support and hardeni
 ng as well as augmentation of specific aspects (e.g. scalability and perfo
 rmance) that are needed in production environments bringing the most value
  to users. Join Rackspace and PLUMgrid product specialists to learn how we
  jointly enable our Private Cloud enterprise users to consume OpenStack an
 d Software Defined Networks (SDN) as ONE solution that brings comprehensiv
 e security\, scalability and performance and a rich set of operational too
 ls.

DESCRIPTION:RSVP required.Roll up your sleeves  build Docker-based web ser
 vices through the OpenStack Orchestration framework. Docker provides a qui
 ck and consistent way to containerize your applications\, making them perf
 ect for deploying on a cloud platform. OpenStack provides an orchestration
  framework\, the Heat project\, to allow end-users to quickly and easily d
 eploy complex services in a consistent\, scalable manner. By combining the
  two\, you now have a powerful tool to help you conquer the world. These f
 rameworks can be intimidating\, however\, and many users stay away because
  they're uncomfortable being responsible for instigating such a severe cha
 nge in the way their company deploys. In this session\, we will introduce 
 the basic concepts of OpenStack Orchestration and Docker\, and provide han
 ds-on experience to help demystify the process and get to that comfort lev
 el. **Note** Attendees will need their own laptop to connect to our local 
 OpenStack instance and fully participate in the lab.

DESCRIPTION:Among the commonly overlooked issues encountered when deployin
 g Neutron is how to route traffic to and from tenant networks. Many deploy
 ments are constrained such that statically routing tenant networks is suff
 icient. However\, when tenants start usingIPv6 and the scale of a deployme
 nt growsdynamic routing of tenant prefixes maybecome preferable to statica
 lly routing tenant prefixes. In this session we will discuss how to use fe
 atures added to Neutron over the last few cycles such as subnet pools\, ad
 dress scopes\, and course Neutron BGP announcement to begin using dynamic 
 routing in conjunction with a Neutron deployment.

DESCRIPTION:As the  Linux community continues to redefine the boundaries 
 of what is possible in a cloud-based Linux distributions running on Intel 
 silicon\, both power and performance play an increasingly important role i
 n the industry. In the Clear Linux Project for Intel Architecture\, we dec
 ided to use the latest GCC technology to boost the performance of a cloud-
 based system. From profile-based techniques (PGO and AutoFDO) to Function 
 Multi-Versioning (compiler feature that is capable of optimizing the same 
 code for multiple architectures and then automatically selecting the corre
 ct architecture-specific version of the code at runtime) we will show how 
 these technologies  can be used to improve runtime performance and unleas
 h the power of IA in  Linux distributions. This presentation will help th
 e cloud developers to better understand the capabilities of the latest ver
 sion of GCC compiler. This will include demos and open source templates th
 at can be reused for their own applications.

DESCRIPTION:As our development projects grew\, and our team more distribut
 ed\, we needed a better way to onboard new developers\, consistently deplo
 y new environments\, and predictably test subcomponents.To solve our requi
 rements\, we turned to containers in order to manage each component and or
 chestrate the full application stack. Although there is a moderate learnin
 g curve for new team members\, these tools have given us a huge benefit in
  lowering the level of effort for each development iteration\, vastly incr
 eased reproducibility\, and have radically simplified the ease in product 
 installation.In this session\, we will walk attendees through our developm
 ent and deployment lifecycle using Docker containers deployed into an Open
 Stack cloud. We will describe how each stage has been improved\, the chall
 enges we encountered\, and the solutions that weve implemented.

DESCRIPTION:The increasing interest around application containers is drive
 n by increasingly sophisticated applications\, often distributed across da
 ta centers. Containers hide the complexity of the underlying infrastructur
 e\, allowing applications to integrate seamlessly and transparently.With t
 he increasing maturity of OpenStack Neutron\, and increasing support for a
  large number of services\, in this session we examine how SDNs can levera
 ge the container technology for supporting "as a Service" components\, whi
 ch as opposed to application containers we call service containers. Such s
 ervices include load balancing\, virtual private networking\, or dynamic r
 outing in the upcoming Mitaka release\, and for which containers can be a 
 key component for any distributed SDN solution that wants to guarantee hig
 hly availability across physical hardware.

SUMMARY:Deep Dive into Elastic Load Balancing Using Octavia

DESCRIPTION:THE CHALLENGE -- how to cost-effectively provide Load Balancin
 g as a Service (LBaaS) for cloud workloads. Customers expect the cloud to 
 support their elastic workloads no matter how large they grow. On one hand
 \, services\, such as LbaaS\, must have the resources to handle huge workl
 oads\; on the other hand\, for the many customers that have very small wor
 kloads\, the (free tier) LBaaS has to use as little resources as possible.
 THE SOLUTION -- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) An Elastic Load-Balancing Ser
 vice dynamically aligns the load-balancing resources with the customer's e
 lastic workloads. Use OpenStack Octavia to implement.THE "DEEP-DIVE" -- Oc
 tavia provides an operator-grade reference implementation of LBaaS for Ope
 nStack\, utilizing HAProxy. Octavia supports various load balancing config
 urations to support different levels of performance\, scalability\, and av
 ailability.  Octavia's new  N+1 (a.k.a active-active\, all active) confi
 guration provides the basis for an Elastic LBaaS.
