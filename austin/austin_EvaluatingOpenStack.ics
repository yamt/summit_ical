DESCRIPTION:The exponential growth of cloud computing services has given r
 ise to the need for standards\, specifications and workloads that can be u
 sed to evaluate the performance of various cloud offerings. During this se
 ssion you will participate in a discussion that will be led by a panel of 
 cloud performance professionals and managers that will focus on the variou
 s tools that have been developed to measure the Cloud and how they are bei
 ng used for Openstack Cloud implementations. This will be an interactive s
 ession and attendees will be encouraged to ask questions\, make comments a
 nd share their experiences with the various tools. Join us and learn how t
 he performance of the cloud is measured.

DESCRIPTION:Regardless of your background\, OpenStack is a fundamental shi
 ft from the way that traditional virtualization and bare-metal deployments
  are built and operated. Just like with learning to run in a Couch-to-5k c
 linic\, this is your coaching team to help you get from zero to hero on Op
 enStack!Attendees will get a walk through of the learning program and be g
 iven resources to spin up a demo environment on their own machines using V
 agrant and VirtualBox. Knowing where to start is as important as knowing h
 ow to start. This will be a very interactive session to help encourage att
 endees to get help with starting their journeys to becoming OpenStack oper
 ators.

DESCRIPTION:One of the greatest inhibitors of adoption of OpenStack in med
 ium sized companies is convincing upper management that its even a viable 
 alternative to their current infrastructure design. Moving to a private cl
 oud can seem daunting but there are methodologies and strategies that can 
 be employed to realize the enormous gains in agility\, control and cost sa
 vings that OpenStack can provide.

DESCRIPTION:As OpenStack has matured over the past5+ years\, we've grown a
  healthy ecosystem of ways to consume OpenStack:there are distributions\, 
 appliances\, managed offerings\, public clouds\, and consulting services t
 o help you build yourcloud. OpenStack can be used for private clouds\, pub
 lic clouds\, and hybrid cloud scenarios\, not to mention use casespecific 
 purposes like NFV. As the software and demand for it have matured though\,
  interoperability betweenOpenStack clouds has become increasingly imporant
 . The DefCore Committee has now released several Guidelinesthat serve as i
 nteroperability standards\, and the Technical Committee and Board of Direc
 tors are considering changesto OpenStack's mission statement that highligh
 t interoperability as a core value.In this talk\, we'll look at the top ba
 rriers to interoperability OpenStack faces today\, and discuss what's bein
 g done toaddress them. We'll also review the latest work from the DefCore 
 Committee and look ahead to it's next challenges.

DESCRIPTION:Enterprises are adopting cloud technologies\, but its not happ
 ening overnight. IT leaders recognize that in order to move production env
 ironments to the cloud\, they have to move development and testing (dev-te
 st) environments first. This allows for gradual cloud adoption\, and quali
 fies the clouds features and capabilities in terms of performance\, securi
 ty\, scalability\, and other aspects of IT management. Below\, we will loo
 k at the benefits of running devtest environments in the cloud.1  Optimal 
 Utilization2  Operational Efficiencies3  Enable Collaboration4  Paralleliz
 ed Tests5  Monitored DeliveryFinal NoteWith the emergence of end users as 
 the primary drivers of new features and solutions\, traditional IT has had
  to transform in order to quickly accommodate expectations. Time to market
  is of the essence and delivery speed has become a critical factor in toda
 ys competitive market landscape. Running devtest in the cloud is the ultim
 ate jumping off point for cloud adoption.

DESCRIPTION:In the three years since OpenStack was declared “ready for b
 usiness\," its growth curve has been phenomenal\, but adoption has not  b
 een without growing pains.We have enlisted this panel of OpenStack experts
  from software\, hardware and services to discuss the real world challenge
 s they have encountered in their actual customer implementations. We will 
 also hear from them ideas and recommendations for where OpenStack needs to
  improve\, and what OpenStack adopters can and should do to maximize their
  chances of success.

SUMMARY:Deploy an Elastic\, Resilient\, Load-Balanced Cluster in 5 Minutes
  with Senlin

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Elasticity\, resiliency\, load-balancing are among of the mos
 t-wanted features for services or applications deployed on a cloud. Howeve
 r\, it takes a non-trivial effort to integrate pieces of technologies from
  different projects. There are many other subtle issues when users are bui
 ding such a solution in a DIY manner.Just think about choosing alarms from
  the various events and meters you can access\; the complicated processes 
 to hook these alarms to the proper operations\; the need to watch your sc
 aling cluster for node failures\; the requirement for load-balancing...Thi
 s talk is about a simple and straightforward approach to deploy and manag
 e a cluster which can be auto-scaled\, load-balanced and resilient to node
  failures. By seemlessly integrating the clustering\, telemetry\, load-bal
 ance and orchestration services\, we will show Senlin as the pivot for a 
 practical\, easy way to build a resource pool of web services on OpenStack

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:We've all heard it before. OpenStack is too complex. There are
  too many projects\, governance procedures\, and communities to keep up wi
 th. There are too many deployment architectures\, tools and configurations
  to get started quickly. Complexity costs. It requires me to have an entir
 e team of OpenStack professionals which I simply can't afford. In survey a
 fter survey Enterprises evaluating OpenStack site complexity as the number
  one barrier to adoption.What is the OpenStack community doing to confront
  this complexity? What more can we do? How will this concern improve or di
 ssipate over coming releases? With a coordinated effort\, how could we mak
 e OpenStack easy understand\, evaluate\, and cost effective to deploy and 
 operate?

DESCRIPTION:Failure is what you expect when you join a new field\, especia
 lly in technology.From our experience\, most people seem to think\, that O
 penStack can solve all their issues\, even the ones they don't know about 
 yet.When it comes to OpenStack\, there are much more problems then you mig
 ht expect at first. Its not only the technology which might be more differ
 ent then people think\, sometimes the whole picture behind it is so differ
 ent\, that they need to adopt\, to get the most out of it.

DESCRIPTION:So you want a private OpenStack cloud? Think you can just grab
  your OpenStack distro of choice and get going? Well think again - nothing
  good comes that easy. Its not just about downloading some files and insta
 lling. There's a whole world of knowledge involved with doing this right\,
  including how to configure\, how to install\, and most importantly how to
  maintain an administer your cloud. This is also one of the areas where th
 e OpenStack ecosystem has moved way beyond what the vanilla OpenStack code
  provides. Some of the important considerations when choosing an OpenStack
  distro are the support\, maintenance\, and management provided by the ven
 dor\, therefore\, you will need to weigh the choices wisely.
