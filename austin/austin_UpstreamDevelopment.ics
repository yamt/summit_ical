DESCRIPTION:As a new contributor to OpenStack\, it can be overwhelming to 
 learn all the moving parts to OpenStack Infrastruture. In this presentatio
 n we'll be diving into the heart of infrastructure and explain everything 
 you need to know about the systems that keep OpenStack working. Common que
 stions like the following and more will be covered:Want to know what this 
 zuul thing is?Used nodepool but have no idea how it works?Why do we have 8
  jenkins masters?What is this gate I hear so much about?Where should I be 
 cloning repositories from?As a developer\, we'll explain how and what each
  system in OpenStack Infrastruture does and how you should be using them.

SUMMARY:OpenStack-Health Dashboard and Dealing with Data from the Gate

DESCRIPTION:The OpenStack gate operates at a tremendous scale there are hu
 ndreds gate jobs run in a single day. It is impossible for anyone to track
  by hand. This is why a lot of tooling has been developed or leveraged to 
 help make sense of things. However\, with all this tooling there is still 
 a complexity problem with the number of tools available.Late in Liberty op
 enstack-health was created\, the goal is to be the first stop for anyone t
 hat is looking at test results can go. It leverages other tools when appro
 priate to try and be a starting point. It is also hosted on the community 
 infrastructure and continuously deployed using the community development i
 nfrastructure.This talk will explain the openstack-health dashboard\, how 
 it works\, it's current limitations\, and the future of the project. It'll
  also cover some related tools that are available and how they all fit tog
 ether\, and how you can use everything together to take a more data driven
  approach to analyze and test OpenStack with the gate.

SUMMARY:Live from Oslo

DESCRIPTION:Oslo.privsep - oslo.privsep is a new evolution of the "rootwra
 p" privilege separation mechanism actively being worked on across a number
  of OpenStack projects. This talk introduces what the changes will look li
 ke from a developer and deployer's point of view\, and a deep dive into so
 me example benchmarks with Neutron. By leveraging sockets for communicatio
 n and native python syscalls instead of external program calls\, oslo.priv
 sep can offer significant performance improvements in projects with freque
 nt rootwrap usage.Oslo.messaging - During the last development cycle\, Osl
 o.Messaging has improved quire a bit\, especially with the implementation 
 of a couple of new drivers. The problem is that weve learned that the way 
 Oslo.Messaging has been implemented is less than optimal. Since it impacts
  every OpenStack project\, changes have the potential to break other proje
 cts and make OpenStack unstable. well talk about the problems and propose 
 new features and ways to redesign Oslo.Messaging. Youll learn about new Os
 lo.Messaging drivers (Pika and ZeroMQ)\, its internals\, and when it is go
 od to use each of them. Well share correct Oslo.Messaging usage\, examples
  of mistakes\, and what we accomplished\, and present our vision for furth
 er development.Documentation - In the last 2 cycles\, the Oslo team has ad
 ded features to several libraries to make documenting dynamic aspects of p
 rojects easier. We'll go over how to use these features to document availa
 ble drivers or other plugins as well as configuration options. We will als
 o talk about how to build similar features to let you turn existing machin
 e-readable data into nicely formatted human-readable documentation.

SUMMARY:What Science Knows About Happiness That Could Transform OpenStack

DESCRIPTION:Until 20 years ago\, the field of happiness was nearly empty. 
 Scientist were more kean to study diseases than something as simple as why
  are we happy?In this session\, I will explain what led me to learn the sc
 ience of happiness\, what are those learnings\, and how they are directly 
 connected to contributing to OpenStack.I will present 10 propositions ever
 y OpenStack contributor could take\, at the individual level\, the projejc
 t team level\, or more globally. Those propositions will not only increase
  the happiness level of contributors\, they will increase the value and im
 pact of their contributions.

SUMMARY:Meet the OpenStack Personas (So Far)

DESCRIPTION:In projects with many users\, personas clarify users\, goals a
 nd the effects of decisions about the backend\, messages\, APIs\, CLIs\, a
 nd GUIs on the many different users.Â The OpenStack UX project and OpenSta
 ck product group hosted a workshop at the IBM Design Austin Studio to deve
 lop personas that represented a wide variety of OpenStack consumer scenari
 os. Attendees included IBM\, HPE\, Intel and RackN. The team\, along with 
 the OpenStack foundation\, conducted a study in 2016 to validate the new p
 ersonas\, which included: Infrastructure Architect\, Service Admin\, Cloud
  Ops\, Customer Ops\, and DevOps Development. In this session\, we will re
 view of the results of this work and discuss our vision with an example. A
 ttendees will meet the personas and learn about the contributions personas
  can make to the community. We also welcome your input about the personas 
 and our vision.

SUMMARY:OpenStack Stable: What It Actually Means to Maintain Stable Branch

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:The OpenStack community maintains stable branches after a rele
 ase. The goal is to backport bug fixes and security fixes. Lots of people 
 seem to have an interest in keeping stable branches around\, but very few 
 actually understand what stable branch maintenance actually involves. This
  talk will cover what stable branch maintenance in the community actually 
 means\, how it works in practice\, and where help is needed.

SUMMARY:OpenAPI as a Standard - A New Way Forward for API Documentation\, 
 Design and Tool

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack API-WG defined Swagger as a standard API documentati
 on way. In the external world also\, Open API initiative is defining Swagg
 er as a standard API specification. So Swagger is a standard way in the wo
 rld now.By defining Swagger as a standard way\, we provide guidelines for 
 API documentation for all OpenStack projects asa community. Then projects 
 use common tooling\, consistent outlines\, and study exemplary examples.In
  addition\, Swagger is not only for API documentation but also for client 
 side implementation. By getting Swagger data via REST API from server side
 \, clients can know available APIs and usage of these APIs.That is great f
 or the OpenStack interoperability.On Nova and Magnum sides\, we are planin
 g Swagger implementation as a next feature. On the documentation side\, we
  are implementing a tool "fairy-slipper" for migrating current API documen
 tation to Swagger format.This session provides the overview of Swagger\, h
 ow to apply Swagger to each project\, and merit for clients.

SUMMARY:A Ring to Rule Them All - Revising OpenStack Internals to Operate 
 Massively Distributed Clouds

DTEND:20160425T222041Z

DESCRIPTION:Academics and industry experts are advocating for going from l
 arge-centralized Cloud Computing infrastructures to smaller ones massively
  distributed at the edge of the network. However to favor the adoption of 
 such a model\, the development of a system in charge of turning such a com
 plex and diverse network of resources into a global Cloud is critical.In t
 his talk\, we introduce the premises of such a system. The novelty of our 
 work is that instead of developing yet another brokering solution\, we cho
 se to revise the OpenStack internals with P2P mechanisms in order to opera
 te in a distributed manner but throughout the same software platform such 
 a geographically spread Cloud. More precisely\, we describe how we extende
 d Nova with an additional driver allowing the use of a distributed key/val
 ue store instead of the centralized SQL backend. Results of experiments co
 nducted on Grid'5000 are promising and pave the way toward a first large-s
 cale and WAN-wide IaaS manager based on OpenStack.
