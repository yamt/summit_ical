SUMMARY:Automating the Deployment of a Secure\, Multi-User HIPAA Enabled S
 park Cluster Using Sahara

DESCRIPTION:Interest in using analytics platforms such as Hadoop and Spark
  to process highly sensitive personal data (e.g.\, health care data\, fina
 ncial records) is on the rise. Platforms for processing this type of data 
 must conform to numerous regulations intended to ensure data privacy\, int
 egrity\, and access control\, thus making their deployment time consuming 
 and error prone. In this talk\, we share our experiences using Sahara to a
 utomate the provisioning of a HIPAA-enabled Spark-as-a-Service platform. W
 e detail the enhancements to Sahara needed to: (i) automate cluster securi
 ty enablement (e.g.\, authentication\, key management\, encryption)\; (ii)
  support multi-user clusters to provide strong isolation\; (iii) enable cl
 uster deployment on SoftLayer through Heat\; and (iv) submit multi-type jo
 bs (e.g\,. Hadoop and Spark) to YARN using Sahara API. Finally\, we discus
 s the lessons learned from our experience with Sahara and share directions
  for further improvements.

SUMMARY:Architecture and Best Practices to Deploy Hadoop and Spark Cluster
 s with Sahara

DESCRIPTION:Using Big Data environments as analytics engines to gain usefu
 l insight on massive amounts of data in a manageable and timely manner can
  be a complex challenge. Using Sahara as the orchestration tool helps clou
 d architects provide high-performance production Hadoop and Spark environm
 ents enabling private cloud deployments that are easy for data scientists 
 to manage and consume. We will provide a reference architecture for a Hado
 op cluster using Intel based systems and Sahara focused on performance and
  ease of use to answer questions regarding security\, storage\, and suppor
 ting future releases without re-installing.Attendees will learn:- Hadoop c
 onfigurations to best utilize CPU and I/O resources- Storage Best practice
 s- New ways to orchestrate a cluster with various Hadoop and Spark workloa
 ds- Published performance benchmark results- LIfe cycle management

SUMMARY:Cloud Platform for IoT: Designing and Evaluating Large-Scale Data 
 Collecting and Storing Platform

DESCRIPTION:Internet of Things is a hot topic today. Many companies are tr
 ying to create new business applications on a concept of IoT such as smart
  city\, connected vehicle or smart grid. The platform for IoT applications
  has some unprecedented characteristics: (1) needs to accept huge number o
 f connections simultaneously (2) needs to be highly reliable and secure (3
 ) needs to be highly scalable.We have designed\, prototyped and evaluated 
 a highly reliable IoT platform for collecting and storing large-scale data
 .In this session\, we will explain our use case and architecture of IoT pl
 atform. We are tackling the following very high requirements during the pr
 ocess of prototyping and evaluating the platform.Receiving and storing mes
 sages from over 10M clients concurrentlyHighly reliable architecture of me
 ssage broking without losing messagesInstant scale-out to process burst tr
 affic rapidlyWe will also discuss how we can adopt OpenStack to IoT backen
 d and share ideas for its enhancement.

DESCRIPTION:  This session covers multi database deployment\, configurat
 ion and debugging on OpenStack Trove. Now Trove supports more datastores t
 han before. this session is about educating OpenStack community on Trove.
  The session also demonstrate some interactions with the Trove API includi
 ng a demonstration of a deployment with a relational database (MySQL) and 
 a non-relational database (MongoDB). This session contains demos on config
 uration\, installation and debugging.   Benefits over traditional datab
 ases.1. Ease of deployment and use2. Easy to configure and deployment3. He
 lp reduces cloud operational costs

SUMMARY:Big Data Rapid Prototyping by Using Magnum with Cinder and Manila
DTSTART:20160428T160000Z
DTEND:20160428T164000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Developers have unique challenges when trying to test against 
 large datasets. Traditionally\, the cost and time associated with copying 
 and storing large amounts (multiple terabytes) of data has been prohibitiv
 e\, leading to test and development being done with synthetic data at best
 . Within the DevOps model for building applications having full sets of re
 al application data to test against is crucial at all stages of an applica
 tion’s lifecycle. Imagine being able to run 1000’s of tests against re
 plicas of entire multi-TB production datasets\, enabling previously unatta
 inable levels of reliability and allowing for an accelerated cadence of ap
 plication development.  We will discuss techniques for presenting multipl
 e full datasets to developers within a containerized environment for both 
 ephemeral and persistent use cases\, leveraging Manila within an OpenStack
  environment.

SUMMARY:Big Data BBQ: Dining at The OpenStack Buffet to Create Cloud Appli
 cations

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack is more than just a collection of services with a gr
 eat dashboard interface\, it is also a platform for building applications 
 that consume and utilize cloud resources. Combine this platform with the p
 ower of big data\, and you have a recipe for scalable\, cloud-aware\, data
  processing applications.In this talk we will follow a developer’s journ
 ey along the path of creating a real-time streaming Spark application on O
 penStack\, exploring methods for creating cloud applications. We will also
  demonstrate how to use OpenStack’s Python clients to configure message 
 queues for data ingestion\, persistent storage for processed data\, and co
 mputing nodes for large scale analytics and visualizations.Attendees shoul
 d expect to walk away from this session with an understanding of how they 
 can use OpenStack to create\, deploy\, update\, and maintain data processi
 ng applications at scale that live entirely in the cloud.
