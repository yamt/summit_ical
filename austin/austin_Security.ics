DESCRIPTION:OpenStack has allowed businesses to improve their efficiency b
 y offloading work into the cloud. Some of that work and data is sensitive\
 , and it would be catastrophic to the business if leaked to competitors. T
 his sensitivity lead OpenStack to implement several encryption features\, 
 but encryption begs the question of who is managing the encryption keys? T
 his talk will examine key management and bring your own key (BYOK) in Open
 Stack. It will briefly describe a couple of encryption features to highlig
 ht which services use encryption keys\, and then go into a discussion of k
 ey management. We will discuss the trust relationships between the differe
 nt parties\, the motivations for bring your own key\, and the benefits and
  drawbacks of BYOK.

DESCRIPTION:Deploying clouds involves plenty of moving pieces.  There’s
  the actual OpenStack code\, the dependencies\, the operating system\, and
  hardware.  It’s no surprise that functionality often takes priority ov
 er security\, but OpenStack-Ansible’s security role is trying to make th
 at process easier. The openstack-ansible-security role delivers strong sec
 urity enhancements (based on the Security Technical Implementation Guide f
 rom the United States government) that are highly customized to avoid disr
 upting the functionality of an OpenStack cloud.In this talk\, Major Hayden
 \, principal architect at Rackspace\, will share the security challenges i
 n OpenStack clouds and how the openstack-ansible-security role can solve s
 ome of them.  The audience will learn what to do when auditors arrive and
  they will see a demo of the role in action.

SUMMARY:Integrate Active Directory with OpenStack Keystone
DTSTART:20160426T170500Z

DESCRIPTION:With keystone v3\, you can use Identity Service to authenticat
 e certain Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) users\, while retaining
  authorization settings and critical service accounts in the Identity Serv
 ice database. This new configuration improves earlier methods by eliminati
 ng a point of failure where an OpenStack environment could experience a se
 rvice outage if the Active Directory Domain Controller became unavailable.
 This session discusses the changes you will need in your Active Directory 
 environment\, multidomain configuration in keystone v3\, high availablity 
 options\, and\, importantly\, how to encrypt sensitive query traffic using
  LDAPS. A presentation for the system administrators using Active Director
 y\, this talk describes how to easily integrate Active Directory with the 
 OpenStack Identity Service.For business leaders\, this talk describes coll
 aborative opportunities between teams\; successful integration will requir
 e buy-in from multiple stakeholders.

DESCRIPTION:Application containerization is one of the coolest technologie
 s in IT. It solves numerous problems\, allows for incredible application d
 ensity\, and can really increase flexibility and responsiveness. But not e
 veryone understands what makes up container security - it's a LOT more tha
 n what application is in the container.In this session\, Red Hats global s
 olution architect leader\, Thomas Cameron\, will talk about the basic comp
 onents of container security. He'll talk about kernel namespaces\, Securit
 y Enhanced Linux\, Linux control groups\, the Docker daemon\, etc. and how
  they all work. He'll provide demonstrations of how each of these technolo
 gies affect security.He'll also talk about tips and tricks for planning a 
 secure container environment\, describe some gotchas about containers\, an
 d debunk some of the security myths about containers.Attendees will unders
 tand the fundamentals of container security when they leave.

SUMMARY:Advances in Keystone's Role Based Access Control

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Keystone provides the mechanism for configuring role based acc
 ess control (RBAC) thoughout the OpenStack deployment. New mechanisms in r
 ecent releases have greatly improved the ability to tune the access contro
 l approach for your deployment. This presentation will walk though the con
 figuration of RBAC in your deployment. To start\, we'll investigate the de
 faults that ship with upstream Keystone. We'll cover a brief overview of r
 equests that have driven the design over the past couple releases. Finally
 \, we'll see customizations making use of the limitation of admin-scoping\
 , role inference rules and domain specific roles that you can use to tailo
 r your deployment to suit your organization.

DESCRIPTION:Security for Software Defined Data Center is a challenge that 
 a lot of enterprises face. At Cerner we wanted to move to an OpenStack bas
 ed SDDC implementation but wanted to ensure that this was done without red
 ucing the security posture of our environment while at the same time enabl
 e an improved level of operational efficiency and lowered TCO. Some of our
  key success indicators include the ability to gain increased visibility a
 nd control against malicious activity within the Data Center and thus secu
 re East-West traffic\, enable this in an automated manner that would allow
  us to deploy virtual security functions such as IPS and enforce policies 
 easily while the virtual security functions continued to maintain an accep
 table level of performance. With these top level requirements\, we started
  working on a solution implementation with Intel® Corporation and Midokur
 a® and are in the midst of our engagement. The key components that are cu
 rrently part of the solution implementation are Intel®

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:In this panel session\, we bring together several Keystone exp
 erts to discuss their experiences with using Keystone in both private clou
 ds and public clouds at scale. Panel members will discuss the efforts they
  have been involved in with configuring and deploying Keystone to address 
 issues such as improving performance at scale. Panel members will discuss 
 their experiences using advanced Keystone features such Fernet tokens and 
 how these features have improved their deployments\, and also what accommo
 dations were needed to support this new feature properly. Panel members wi
 ll also discuss how they are preparing for Keystone's deprecation of its e
 ventlet deployment model. Panel members from private cloud and public clou
 d\, both vendor and non-vendor\, will discuss Keystone issues that are mos
 t impactful to them and how they are driving Keystone in upcoming releases
  to improve its deployability\, operability\, and consumability.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:It is regularly reported that the number one blocker of cloud 
 (and OpenStack) adoption is the perception that clouds are insecure\, hard
  to protect environments - the reports aren’t wrong!Things are improving
  though\, Security Project members are working hard to: -Secure code at t
 he gate (Bandit) -Secure the API (Syntribos) -Provide internal PKI for T
 LS everywhere (Anchor) -Provide Security Guidance\, Notes\, Advisories et
 c -Encrypt at rest (Leeson\, BYOK)In this talk the current Security Proje
 ct PTL will explain what the Security Project is doing to improve the secu
 rity of OpenStack services and allow OpenStack to differentiate in terms o
 f Security.

SUMMARY:Continuous Compliance & Enforcement of Location-Based Policies in 
 an OpenStack Cloud
DTSTART:20160426T223019Z
DTEND:20160426T231059Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Study after study shows that security is still the biggest bar
 rier to cloud adoption\, with compliance and data protection being top con
 cerns for a CISO.    Enterprises often have a need to enforce policies
  (based on data sovereignty requirements) such as virtual workloads should
  only be placed\, or migrated\, based on location and assurance of hardwar
 e platform. Some others  want to launch VMs/Apps/Containers on Servers w
 ith Boot Integrity – Platform Trust\, while some have a need to extend t
 he chain of trust from platform to workload (VM/Container). This session 
 features a customer case study from Visa with technologies from Intel (CIT
 \, TXT and TPM)\, HPE (Helion OpenStack and Proliant Gen 9 server) and Clo
 ud Raxak (RaxakProtect) that demonstrates end-to-end compliance (boot time
  to shutdown) using hardware and software attestations.

SUMMARY:Using Open Source Security Architecture to Defend against Targeted
  Attacks
DTSTART:20160426T223019Z
DTEND:20160426T231059Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:A network IPS can effectively defend your OpenStack cloud agai
 nst targeted attacks\, even at large scale\, once enabled as a virtual net
 work function (VNF).Traditional security approaches in OpenStack\, such as
  security groups and FWaaS\, lack flexibility and manageability. These sol
 utions also do not provide sophisticated active responses like running def
 ensive scripts in case of attacks\, and are not effective in protecting bi
 g enterprise clouds against sophisticated cyber attacks.A network IPS deli
 vered through Tap-as-a-Service and vRouter (enabled by the Fuel Contrail p
 lugin) as a forwarding plane can identify targeted attacks by monitoring a
 nd analyzing east-west traffic.Moreover\, we extend the architecture with 
 an open source malware sandbox (e.g. Cuckoo or PyBox) as an IPS back end t
 o identify targeted attacks (e.g. CloudAtlas and Minidionis APTs)\, and he
 lp an incident response team with a forensic investigation.We will demonst
 rate features and discuss security best practices.
