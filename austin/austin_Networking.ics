DESCRIPTION:DSCP is used by large enterprises to manage network traffic in
 telligently. It provides quality of service to enable traffic engineering\
 , and in some cases can additionally be relied on to enforce network secur
 ity policies. The inclusion of DSCP in Newton Neutron now makes this facil
 ity available to all users\, from individuals to large enterprises. This t
 alk will describe DSCP for those unfamiliar with it\, discuss how DSCP is 
 used in the wild today\, and relate the path taken to deliver the Open vSw
 itch-based reference implementation for Newton.

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack is a large cloud platform\, which can be configured\
 , used and be broken innumerable ways. On the other hand configure network
 ing is usually tricky especially in a large environment both with OpenStac
 k or in general\, so most probably you asked the question "Why is my netwo
 rking not working?" several times already in your life. In this presentati
 on we are going to describe the common problems that can occur and we will
  list different techniques and systematic approaches to find the solutions
  to these issues. Whether you are beginner or advanced\, if you are strugg
 ling much with networking in your cloud\, join us to learn new solutions o
 r just to bring home a good troubleshooting guide.

DESCRIPTION:Today OpenStack is able to track the state of hypervisors hard
 ware with nova compute running on each hypervisor node. With state of the 
 hardware known\, OpenStack can do a better job at finding out the Hypervis
 or that matches the resource needed to host a Virtual Machine.Although Neu
 tron agents collect some state data for the Network Nodes\, Neutron has n
 o knowledge of the state of the physical networking devices.In this presen
 tation\, we will discuss the following ideas to leverage network health mo
 nitoring for your OpenStack workloads:Nova to Neutron interaction for phy
 sical network details - we will discuss the APIs that allow operators to i
 ntegrate the physical network information for use in workload placementUsi
 ng Ceilometer to collect physical network stats - we will discuss how heal
 th of physical network can be modeled to provide operational insightNetwor
 k aware Nova Scheduler - a Nova scheduler that considers the network condi
 tions while selecting a hypervisor for the workload.

DESCRIPTION:Neutron IP Address Management (IPAM) APIs were first release i
 n the Liberty Release. The session describes our experience developing an 
 external IPAM system for OpenStack. The IPAM is part of Romana\, a new ope
 n source Cloud Native SDN solution. IPAM is central to the way Romana crea
 tes multi-tenant networks without an overlay. In this session\, we will d
 escribe the hierarchical IP addressing scheme used by Romana for Cloud Nat
 ive Networks and how it assigns addresses based on tenant\, project and se
 gment IDs to maintain the L3 heirarchy necessary for route aggregation. We
  also describe our IPAM driver design and the challenges we faced delaying
  address calculation until after the target Compute Node had been identifi
 ed.We will also demo OpenStack using Romana’s IPAM when launching VMs ac
 ross Nodes.

  on using conntrack implemented in Open vSwitch kernel space\; one of this
  implementations is called to even replace the default iptables based secu
 rity group firewall driver.Benchmarks comparing the two new security group
  firewall drivers with the current iptables security group firewall driver
  will be shown and bothapproaches will be described in detail with pros an
 d cons of each identified and including showing tips on how to debug lost 
 packets in the firewall.

DESCRIPTION:Networking is one of the most challenging aspects to running O
 penStack. There exists a lot of SDN vendor plugins and it is very difficul
 t for customer to recognise what is and is not slideware. We both spend mo
 re than 3 years by working and testing different Neutron vendor solutions.
  We have come to several insights into CPU penalties\, Network design issu
 es at scale as well as performance comparisons using different encapsulati
 on techniques.This presentation will cover architectural and performance c
 haracteristics of what a Overlay network is compared to a straight VLAN ba
 sed environment on a cluster size of 100+ nodes.We will also cover best pr
 actices and experience obtained by running a full routable L3 network in a
  production environment with a high number of security policies enforced a

SUMMARY:Neutron Address Scopes

DTEND:20160428T144059Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:An exciting new feature was just added to OpenStack Neutron in
  the Mitaka release\; it's called address scopes.  Address scopes build fr
 om the subnet pools feature added in Kilo.  While subnet pools give us a m
 echanism for controlling the allocation of addresses to subnets\, address 
 scopes give Neutron a way to know where addresses are viable.  They are al
 so the thing within which addresses are not allowed to overlap.In this tal
 k\, we will give a quick review of subnet pools and then talk about how th
 ey support address scopes.  Address scopes are key to overcoming the probl
 em of "bring your own addressing" (BYOA) and are instrumental in determini
 ng where traffic should be blocked or where net address translation (NAT) 
 should be applied (or not).  This is especially important when designing y
 our cloud for IPv6.Finally\, we will briefly discuss the relationship betw
 een address scopes and two other exciting new features in Neutron:  "BGP d
 ynamic routing" and "routed networks."

DESCRIPTION:The maximum transmission unit (MTU) defines the maximum size o
 f IP packets sent over a network. Similar to physical networks\, neutron c
 ontains a variety of layer-2 and layer-3 components that include MTU param
 eters. Improperly configuring neutron MTU parameters or options that impac
 t MTU parameters can degrade network performance or cause packet loss in o
 bscure places. We plan to cover the following topics:Introduction to MTU: 
 What is it and why does it matter? What is path MTU discovery?Example of v
 alid and invalid MTU configurations on a physical network.Relate physical 
 networks to virtual networks.Discuss neutron MTU problems using both the L
 inux bridge and Open vSwitch agents on physical networks with 1500 and 900
 0 byte MTUs.Discuss our solution to these problems.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:The current Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) implementation su
 pports routing traffic between virtual instances and routing traffic to ex
 ternal networks that support the OVS plugin. For the last couple of cycles
 \, DVR has gained momentum within the developer and user community and has
  matured to scale and support other deployment models. For certain workloa
 ds inclusion of bare metal servers into a cloud deployment is almost a mus
 t. Therefore\, it is now time to extend the DVR routing capability to rout
 e the traffic to and from the bare metal servers managed by OpenStack Iron
 ic.In this talk\, we will be presenting:1. How OpenStack Ironic connects b
 are metal servers to the neutron networks.2. A proposal on how DVR can be 
 extended to enable routing of data traffic between the virtual machines th
 at reside in VLAN or VXLAN networks in the cloud and the bare metal server
 s managed by Ironic that reside in a different VLAN segment.

  each compute node how to actually put the packets on the wire. Finally\,
  we will talk about the assumptions Neutron currently makes about segments
  and how they are being adjusted during the Mitaka and Newton cycle to wor
 k with restricted L2 topologies without overlays. If you've ever seen the

DTEND:20160428T164059Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:L3 high availability was introduced in Neutron during the Juno
  cycle. L3 high availability in Neutron provides a reliable L3 connectivit
 y without losing the agent scalability. High Availability of L3 agent will
  ensure there will be very little downtime between external and internal n
 etworks connectivity.With the introduction of Distributed Virtual Routers 
 the routers are now distributed across the compute Nodes for scalability a
 nd high availability is achieved through distributed routers. Even though 
 DVR has distributed the routers and the DNAT functionality\, the SNAT func
 tionality is still handled in the Networking Node\, which again brings in 
 the requirement for a high availability solution for SNAT.In order to addr
 ess this issue\, Distributed Router SNAT High Availability work was pursue
 d during the Kilo and was completed in Mitaka cycle. This talk will provid
 e an overview of the L3 HA\, provide details of the DVR SNAT HA scheduler\
 , config options with respect to legacy and dvr routers

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:The flexibility of SDNs in contrast to traditional networks th
 at are bounded to hardware restrictions is increasing the need to provide 
 SDN scalability benchmarks such as the maximum number of routers\, network
 s or virtual machines\; what is the supported workload or the maximum flow
  setup rate.Although SDN is revolutionizing data center networks\, its tes
 ting\, benchmarking and monitoring at scale remains a major challenge whic
 h requires the tools capable of handling thousands of resources\, such as 
 ports or instances as well as the traffic between them.This talk presents 
 the scalability tests done for MidoNet with OpenStack Neutron using open s
 ource tools. Midonet-sandbox uses Docker containers to automate the deploy
 ment of the infrastructure under test\, OpenStack Rally runs first OpenSta
 ck Tempest for sanity checks then Neutron tasks for addressing scalability
  benchmark tests while monitoring different metrics such as virtual topolo
 gy objects count with InfluxDB\, Telegraf and Grafana.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:SDN moves management functions out of the hardware and places

DESCRIPTION:We introduce a Policy Canvas which is a highly user-friendly a
 nd simple front-end interface to manage policies like drawing diagrams on 
 whiteboard or note. Most administrators and operators draw their policies 
 first in hand and translate them to specific policy languages or commands 
 manually. It is error-prone and requires much time and effort. Our system 
 provides a unified and simple graph drawing tool for specifying policies f
 or multiple OpenStack services. It can automatically translate the graph m
 odel to relevant OpenStack services using APIs and commands. In addition\,
  some of the policies can be given by multiple stakeholders such as tenant
 \, cloud operator\, system administrator\, or application developers. Our 
 system can detect/resolve conflicts as much as possible. In this session\,
  we introduce our Policy Canvas running on Horizon and demonstrate how to
  create multiple network policies and automatically deploy them to the Ope
 nStack via Congress and Neutron.

SUMMARY:Practical OVN: Architecture\, Deployment\, and Scale of OpenStack 
 Networking
DTSTART:20160428T201001Z
DTEND:20160428T205041Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:OVN is a network virtualization project that brings virtual ne
 tworking to the Open vSwitch user community and is the latest iteration of
  Open vSwitch integration for OpenStack. It is an open source project bein
 g developed by the core OVS development community\, which includes large-s
 cale network operators. In this talk\, we will cover the state of OVN with
  a focus on deployment. Topics include using overlay and local network con
 figurations\, implementing security policies\, gateway placement\, current
  scale limits\, and future feature plans

SUMMARY:Understanding ML2 Port Binding
DTSTART:20160428T201001Z
DTEND:20160428T205041Z

DESCRIPTION:The Modular Layer 2 (ML2) core plugin underlies the majority o
 f Neutron deployments\, including those using the reference Open vSwitch a
 nd Linux Bridge L2 agents\, as well as various vendor-specific solutions. 
 If you've deployed\, operated\, or even just used an ML2-based setup\, you
  may have encountered"binding failed" errors\, and wondered what could hav
 e gone wrong. Or you may just want to better understand how ML2 works and 
 what it can do.The focus of this session\, ML2's "port binding"\, is the p
 rocess by which the ML2 plugin selects themechanism driver(s) and network 
 segment(s) tobe utilized for a specific Neutron port. Port binding must su
 cceed before a port will provide the requested connectivity. Its outcome c
 onfigures the datapath and determines the details needed by Nova or other 
 services to connect to the desired Neutron network. Port binding enables M
 L2 to support heterogeneous environments. Understanding how it works is cr
 itical to getting the most out of ML2.

SUMMARY:Tap-As-A-Service:  What You Need to Know Now
DTSTART:20160428T211000Z

DESCRIPTION:Tap-as-a-Service is a relatively new OpenStack project that wa
 s designed to provide tenants and service providers a means of monitoring 
 the traffic flowing in their Neutron provisioned virtual networks. A lot o
 f work has been carried out in the last two cycles\, with multiple develop
 ers from around the world now contributing to the cause.This presentation
  offers a review of all the progress made to date. We will discuss the pr
 imary motivations for monitoring network activity\, explore the major cha
 llenges one can expect to encounter when attempting to monitor network tra
 ffic in a cloud environment and describe the need for a platform oriented 
 solution. Next\, an overview of the TaaS architecture and API will be pr
 esented\, along with an update on current development activities and some
  of the planned enhancements for the future. We will also demonstrate traf
 fic visibility solutions for a representative set of use cases covering ne
 twork trouble-shooting\, security and analytics.

SUMMARY:Dynamic Routing of Networks in the Cloud
DTSTART:20160428T211001Z
DTEND:20160428T215021Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Among the commonly overlooked issues encountered when deployin
 g Neutron is how to route traffic to and from tenant networks. Many deploy
 ments are constrained such that statically routing tenant networks is suff
 icient. However\, when tenants start usingIPv6 and the scale of a deployme
 nt growsdynamic routing of tenant prefixes maybecome preferable to statica
 lly routing tenant prefixes. In this session we will discuss how to use fe
 atures added to Neutron over the last few cycles such as subnet pools\, ad
 dress scopes\, and course Neutron BGP announcement to begin using dynamic 
 routing in conjunction with a Neutron deployment.

SUMMARY:Containerizing Network Services
DTSTART:20160428T220019Z
DTEND:20160428T224059Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:The increasing interest around application containers is drive
 n by increasingly sophisticated applications\, often distributed across da
 ta centers. Containers hide the complexity of the underlying infrastructur
 e\, allowing applications to integrate seamlessly and transparently.With t
 he increasing maturity of OpenStack Neutron\, and increasing support for a
  large number of services\, in this session we examine how SDNs can levera
 ge the container technology for supporting "as a Service" components\, whi
 ch as opposed to application containers we call service containers. Such s
 ervices include load balancing\, virtual private networking\, or dynamic r
 outing in the upcoming Mitaka release\, and for which containers can be a 
 key component for any distributed SDN solution that wants to guarantee hig
 hly availability across physical hardware.

SUMMARY:Deep Dive into Elastic Load Balancing Using Octavia
DTSTART:20160428T220019Z
DTEND:20160428T224059Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:THE CHALLENGE -- how to cost-effectively provide Load Balancin
 g as a Service (LBaaS) for cloud workloads. Customers expect the cloud to 
 support their elastic workloads no matter how large they grow. On one hand
 \, services\, such as LbaaS\, must have the resources to handle huge workl
 oads\; on the other hand\, for the many customers that have very small wor
 kloads\, the (free tier) LBaaS has to use as little resources as possible.
 THE SOLUTION -- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) An Elastic Load-Balancing Ser
 vice dynamically aligns the load-balancing resources with the customer's e
 lastic workloads. Use OpenStack Octavia to implement.THE "DEEP-DIVE" -- Oc
 tavia provides an operator-grade reference implementation of LBaaS for Ope
 nStack\, utilizing HAProxy. Octavia supports various load balancing config
 urations to support different levels of performance\, scalability\, and av
 ailability.  Octavia's new  N+1 (a.k.a active-active\, all active) confi
 guration provides the basis for an Elastic LBaaS.
