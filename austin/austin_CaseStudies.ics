SUMMARY:Overstock.com's OpenStack Networking Strategy: Eliminating Network
  Failover Time

DESCRIPTION:Overstock.com recently made the big leap from nova-network to 
 Neutron networking in order to increase network resiliency and reduce fail
 over time. We also chose to use the MidoNet Neutron plugin.The results hav
 e been fantastic!It used to be that moving 100 networks from the active no
 va-network node to the passive one resulted in network downtime for fiftee
 n long\, finger-crossing\, pit-sweating minutes for us. Now that we have f
 ully distributed\, active/active network gateways\, there is no failover. 
 We now perform maintenance and reboots on our gateways and controllers in 
 the middle of the day and our users do not feel it. We also gained full vi
 sibility into all of our network flows within our clouds!As an extra bonus
 \, we now get to sit at the cool kids' table and throw around neat buzz-wo
 rds like "SDN" and "VxLAN Tunnels". Come join us and we'll tell you what w
 e did and show you how well it works.

DESCRIPTION:Building a consortium of often competing\, industry\, governme
 nt\, academic and research leaders can be difficult. While all members may
  agree that they are dedicated to building a great open source community\,
  their competing interests\, motivations and business models\, can create 
 a barrier to bringing people together for a common cause. In this session\
 , two successful consortium models from: Japans Okinawa Open Laboratory (O
 OL) and Canadas Centre of Excellence in Next Generation Networks (CENGN)\,
  will be presented. Both are running OpenStack environment to test\, valid
 ate and commercialize SDN and NFV prototypes\, products\, applications and
  services. And both centres have similar mandates: to bridge the gap betwe
 en research and industry and ensure they are global leaders in the innovat
 ion and commercialization of the technologies that will underpin the next 
 generation of converged global communication networks.

 ow many projects does an OpenStack cloud typically run?Are OpenStacks APIs
  the standard for enterprise Infrastructure-as-a-Service (Iaas)?What do st
 ackers do all day? (Hint: the role they do most is new to the survey this 
 year)Check out openstack.org/user-survey after April 13 to download the fu

DESCRIPTION:Winning an EU tender in late 2015\, the CTA (cloudteamalliance
 .com) was awarded to provide Openstack based public IAAS services to 52 Eu
 ropean Institutions\, including the EU Parliament\, EU Council\, EU Commis
 sion\, ENISA (EU cyber-security agency)\, Commission of Justice etc.The co
 nsortium is an all-star european team and is made by Numergy (FRA)\, Gigas
  (ESP)\, Portugal Telecom (PRT) and Enter (ITA). Among these\, Enter and N
 umergy both run two of the largest Openstack-based public clouds. The EU 
 DIGIT (Direction generale IT) explicitly requested for Openstack to power 
 EU clouds for its openness\, portability\, transparency. The goal was to a
 void proprietary solutions and vendor lock-ins. Moreover\, security after 
 the NSA PRISM scandal was a primary concern. In this talk we will explain
  how the EU agencies will be empowered by Openstack and a fully open sourc
 e IAAS.

DESCRIPTION:The Indigo DataCloud project's ultimate goal is to provide a s
 ustainable European infrastructure for science\, spanning multiple compute
 r centers and existing public clouds. CERN is one of the members of the co
 llaboration\, offering its OpenStack resources and participating in the de
 sign of the infrastructure.The participating sites form a set of heterogen
 eous infrastructures\, some running OpenNebula and several public clouds r
 unning proprietary software. There was the need to find a common denominat
 or for the deployment of both the required PaaS services and the end user 
 applications. CloudFormation or Heat were technically viable options\, but
  tied to specific implementations. TOSCA on the other hand is on its way t
 o becoming a standard to model the full stack\, with growing support in di
 fferent communities.In this presentation we will cover and demo concrete e
 xamples of using TOSCA to model a complex infrastrustructure covering mult
 iplesites.

DESCRIPTION:In this presentation we will talk about how ScaleUp Technologi
 es launched a Public Cloud Service based on OpenStack. Initially a commerc
 ial stack was used to build a cloud in 2010 but had license restrictions a
 nd lacked scalability and innovation. Since an object based storage servic
 e was needed\, OpenStack Swift was deployed as a standalone setup. The Swi
 ft installation was later merged into a new combined installation for Nova
 \, which replaced the commercial cloud stack.We will talk about which reas
 ons lead to the decision to build the object storage cloud with OpenStack 
 (and later replace the commercial stack with OpenStack) and how ScaleUp ac
 complished this task with a small team. We will share our experience and k
 nowledge on "Vanilla" OpenStack\, its benefits and how we eventually 
 built a fully redundant stack on an existing hardware infrastructure.

 community. The development of this cutting edge cloud infrastructure has b
 een technically challenging\, and here we provide an in depth case study e
 ncompassing the design and implementation of our system over the last 18 m
 onths\; highlighting key pitfalls – and solutions – that are of releva
 nce to anyone who is interested in commissioning or implementing a cloud i

SUMMARY:Monitoring a Multi-Region Cloud Based on OpenStack: The FIWARE Lab
  Case Study
DTSTART:20160428T165000Z
DTEND:20160428T173000Z

DESCRIPTION:FIWARE Lab is a multi-region federated Cloud\, based on OpenSt
 ack. Currently it comprises 15 regions spread all over Europe (but with a 
 presence also in LatAm). It offers a capacity of more than 3000 cores\, 10
  TB RAM\, 500 TB disk and is going to be further expanded with the additio
 n of new regions/nodes.By leveraging Ceilometer and Monasca\, we developed
  a distributed and scalable monitoring system for FIWARE Lab able to colle
 ct\, process\, analyse and finally present the relevant data to the intere
 sted users. This presentation will focus on the architecture of the soluti
 on and on how two OpenStack projects have been customized\, enhanced and d
 eployed in order to meet the expected requirements: collection of custom r
 esource metrics and sanity check measurements\, data confidentiality and d
 ata replication\, real time data vs historical aggregated data on differen
 t dimensions (time\, tenant\, “space”)\, data analytics\, unified cros
 s-region data visualization. Finally a short demo is presented.

SUMMARY:How Burton Snowboards Is Carving Down the OpenStack Trail

DESCRIPTION:Enterprise IT is under pressure to store and protect more data
  than ever before\, but budgets are not growing at the same rate. For cost
  reasons alone\, scaling out a traditional SAN or NAS was not an answer. W
 e @ Burton looked for alternatives\, and while we did not have cloud appli
 cations\, we found that we could use OpenStack as a starting project for g
 etting into OpenStack\, and specifically Swift for storing Commvault backu
 ps.This session will share how Burton discovered OpenStack object storage 
 as a solution\, and the criteria that went into choosing to deploy it for 
 both immediate and future needs. Part of the sharing includes how we have 
 utilized our private cloud after the initial deployment. Like Burton\, you
  may also have applications running in your environment that already suppo
 rt object storage APIs like Swift and S3.

DESCRIPTION:G-Core\, a Luxembourg-based global IT solutions provider\, has
  moved its G-Core Innovations IT infrastructure (DCs) to OpenStack from VM
 ware. With Wargaming as a key client\, this solution will support its mili
 tary MMOs\, with a multimillion user base\, including World of Tanks and W
 orld of Warships.When one says these games are popular\, they mean that mo
 re than 1 million users are playing simultaneously (http://bit.ly/1TA5Ggw)
 . To make that possible\, G-Core provides Wargaming with more than 20 data
  centers (consisting of thousands of servers) all over the world.G-Core ha
 s a huge and complex infrastructure to provide stable solutions\, capable 
 of enduring high loads. Using this experience\, G-Core is able to find sol
 utions and share expertise with other companies that require a competitive
  and robust service. This case study shows the huge\, infrastructural move
  from VMware to OpenStack and describes the basic architectural solutions 
 of the project.

SUMMARY:Embracing OpenStack - The Verizon User Story Journey
DTSTART:20160428T201001Z

DESCRIPTION:The road to embrace OpenStack at Verizon offers lessons in the
  need for companies to manage the business\, cultural and technical change
 s that come with any large systems implementation\, while overcoming the u
 nique challenges of incorporating OpenStack into an organization unfamilia
 r with the open source model. As a telecommunications giant\, Verizon has 
 a large and complex heterogeneous portfolio of applications and systems to
  support its global businesses and products. Verizon looked to use OpenSta
 ck because it has the capability for the hyper scale and flexibility to su
 pport the company's many interconnected requirements. However\, such a fun
 damental change to the company's systems and processes is not going to hap
 pen overnight.During this session we will share both the successes and les
 sons learned in implementing OpenStack into the Verizon environment.
