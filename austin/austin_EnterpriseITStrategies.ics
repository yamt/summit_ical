DESCRIPTION:The Enterprise Working Group has been discussing various strat
 egies to help enterprise architects understand how to deploy tenant-level 
 workloads on OpenStack. With the Project Navigator and Sample Configuratio
 n in place\, the team has started creating multiple Workload Reference Arc
 hitecture diagrams targetted for different use cases. In this session\, we
  will present our work that has been done over the past few months and sha
 re reference architectures to the audience.

DESCRIPTION:More and more enterprises are looking at how to bring agile in
 frastructure to their application developers\, providing developers the to
 ols they need to create\, deploy and iterate apps faster. But in the real 
 world\, there are practical limitations like SLA obligations\, latency iss
 ues\, and resource capacity. These demand caution when moving to agile inf
 rastructure.Justin Shepherd\, a Distinguished Architect at Rackspace\, and
  Travis Newhouse\, Chief Architect at AppFormix\, will talk about the pitf
 alls and challenges of operating agile infrastructure for enterprise users
  with practical considerations like those mentioned above. They’ll share
  experiences from enterprises\, such as ViaSat\, a global provider of sate
 llite broadband and wireless services\, infrastructure\, and technology. 
 You’ll learn why enterprises are taking the agile journey\, what issues 
 they encounter along the way\, and how OpenStack helps to deliver a self-s
 ervice environment so developers can create new value for customers throug
 h software innovation.

DESCRIPTION:Starting with a total cost of ownership (TCO) of an OpenStack 
 cloud\, we examine the strategic tuning knobs you have available to provid
 e the best solution for your organization. We will introduce the TCO model
 \, as well as using standard financial accounting practices to build a bas
 is for calculating the hidden costs of your OpenStack cloud.The presentati
 on will provide a basic overview of the accounting principles required\, b
 ut to get the most out of the model\, it helps if you share and talk throu
 gh with your finance team.

SUMMARY:Intelligent Workload HA in Openstack
DTSTART:20160425T170500Z
DTEND:20160425T174540Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:One of the primary requirements of an enterprise customer host
 ed on a private cloud is guaranteed availability of their workload. Althou
 gh Openstack natively supports some forms of HA\, there is a big gap from 
 the enterprise perspective.Specifically the gaps are if a compute node goe
 s down\, the VMs have to be manually evacuated. With most platforms having
  Predictive failure detection mechanisms\, there is no way to live-migrate
  VMs to healthier nodes either.This proposal addresses these gaps thru dev
 eloping a HA framework that is both ReActive and ProActive.With reactive H
 A\, we will show how the VMs running on a compute node which goes down\, c
 an automatically be restored.With proactive HA\, we will show how the fram
 ework triggers Live Migrations in case of high thermal signature\, predict
 ive hardware failures\, host maintenance mode\, slow application performan
 ce due to bottlenecks\, and other custom triggers (ceilometer alarms\, zab
 bix)thus mitigating VM down-time for enterprise workloads

DESCRIPTION:Bringing OpenStack into an existing enterprise environment req
 uires careful planning to be successful. While it would be nice to have al
 l your internal developers\, external vendors\, and government regulators 
 migrate (yesterday!) to the distributed architecture that makes cloud so p
 owerful\, the reality is that we're still running code from the 1960's in 
 demanding production environments (hello\, mainframe!) and it's reasonable
  to expect that there are still years\, if not decades\, left dealing with
  traditional\, monolithic\, vertically-scaling workloads. This session wil
 l discuss how you can successfully integrate your upcoming OpenStack deplo
 yment into the stuff you already have\, maximizing the benefits (automatio
 n! self-service! scalability!) while mitigating the risk of changing too m
 uch too soon. Topics will include Active Directory\, DR\, integrating with
  Windows\, migrating workloads to the cloud\, patch management strategies\
 , and more.

 sites running on Physical infrastructure platforms that generates Billions
  $ revenue. We orchestrated the entire deployment thru OneOps\, that manag
 es the VM lifecycle\, application/env provisioning and automated code depl
 oyment. These websites were scaled horizontally they performed faster and 
 better on clouds last Holiday season. These sites on the cloud scaled thru
  xxxxx M page views\, xxxK transactions/sec with 100% uptime thru Holiday.
  This lift and shift enabled us reduce infrastructure cost and capacity fo

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack cloud adoption is driving the need for industrialize
 d migration strategies to move business critical applications\, and their 
 associated workloads\, from legacy cloud environments to OpenStack cloud p
 latforms.The challenge: how can enterprise IT perform the migrations of th
 e complex\, in-production business critical application systems from legac
 y clouds to OpenStack clouds in an efficient\, reliable\, and industrializ
 ed manner?Strategies currently being used and perfected in actual migratio
 ns to OpenStack clouds will be presented\, and specific toolsets and servi
 ces/process will reviewed and discussed in detail.A tenant migration  mana
 gement lifecycle model will be presented  discussed. This model will illus
 trate how the services approach and toolsets described above can be a high
 ly effective solution in the onboarding\, management\, and optimization of
  business critical applications within OpenStack clouds.

DESCRIPTION:A vendor-neutral look at real obstacles and architectural so
 lutions for Information Security compliance when deploying OpenStack. So 
 you think the architecure is complete\, but perhaps the security division 
 didn't really understand it as well as you thought? Bringing OpenStack int
 o an enterprise environment can often present big challenges for a conven
 tional Information Security organisation - and big obstacles for the deplo
 yer.How can long-established approval processes apply to cloud?Can orchest
 ration and automation work through these barriers?Why do all these network
  trunks terminate in those boxes?Where do the firewalls go?But CI can impr
 ove security\, right?This session takes real-life deployment issues from
  several large-scale deployment projects across different customers (finan
 cial services\, telecomunications\, manufacturing) and presents solution a
 pproaches for each.

DESCRIPTION:Upgrading a huge software stack is always a big problem in a p
 roduction environment. Too many services relying on the availability of th
 e software stack. This problem is more frequent while upgrading OpenStack 
 in production. Complete teams or companies are not able to work when the C
 loud is not reachable and the downtime can cost thousands of dollars. Due 
 to these problem and other risks\, Clouds with OpenStack in production are
 n’t upgraded often. Operators don’t want to take the risk and stress e
 very six months to keep their OpenStack  environment up to date. Security
  patches get backported and new features from the newer releases are not n
 eeded. But then they need to upgrade over multiple releases which is not s
 upported yet.Customers and operators need a solution to how they can upgra
 de a cloud easily while skipping a release. This talk will give an overvie
 w about the whole problem and will also give a possible solution which wil
 l fit in most use cases.

DESCRIPTION:SAP provides a number of offerings where HANA systems are made
  available to customers in a cloud environment. In this environment\, reso
 urces are shared among numerous HANA deployments\, with secure network\, s
 torage\, and access control to ensure the confidentiality of customer data
  and operations. A custom\, in-house baremetal infrastructure lifecycle ma
 nagement solution was created in order to deploy and manage the resources 
 used to deliver these HANA landscapes in the cloud. However\, other intern
 al management systems also exist to manage different types of cloud enviro
 nments\, including virtual machines for smaller HANA systems. To consolida
 te these systems into a single infrastructure and environment\, we are beg
 inning to move from a fully in-house solution to a hybrid solution\, using
  OpenStack as a common management framework. The work presented in this do
 cument describes our approach to adopting OpenStack within our existing ba
 remetal infrastructure management solution\, which will soon be used in pr
 oduction. It should also be noted that this work will be also used to supp
 ort other baremetal infrastructure management use cases within SAP’s clo
 ud portfolio.

DESCRIPTION:Cloud Tenants are key stakeholders in the OpenStack cloud comm
 unity. Their support is critical for driving the adoptions and expansion o
 f OpenStack clouds.Many of the driving requirements of cloud tenants are b
 usiness\, operational\, and management focused.The ability of the OpenStac
 k cloud platform and enterprise IT to meet these requirements will have a 
 large influence on the advocacy of these key stakeholders.Example tenant s
 cenarios (derived from actual cloud projects) illustrating these tenant ne
 eds\, their implications\, and how they were met will be reviewed and disc
 ussed.Call to action: specific proposals will be presented on how the Open
 Stack community can more directly address the business and operational man

DESCRIPTION:Once again\, cloud computing is at a technical inflection poi
 nt. Just as advances in networking and virtualization gave way to the SaaS
  revolution\, the next revolution in computing will come about as a direct
  result of the advances in private cloud deployments with OpenStack and th
 e ability to package and distribute code via container technologies such a
 s Docker.Today\, nearly 16 years after the term SaaS was first coined\, en
 terprises are realizing SaaS solutions limit access to their own data and 
 at times put that data at grave risk. New "private SaaS" business model\, 
 enabled by high compute distribution and container technologies\, combine
  the best of SaaS models with the security and data locality of private c
 loud models.Managed software as a service will enable companies to effort
 lessly download and install complex server software solutions to run in t
 heir datacenters of choice\, while allowing the software vendors to provid
 e SaaS-like management services to the stack.
