DESCRIPTION:Companies new to OpenStack will often go through an initial ti
 me period to build a proof-of-concept cloud. If the team building it succe
 eds and is given the green light to bring OpenStack to the enterprise\, th
 ey may find themselves in a situation where they have to build out OpenSta
 ck as quickly as possible\, put it into production and support the users w
 ho are using it. What does it take to run an OpenStack environment? Some o
 f the topics to be discussed include:What is operations and how do you ope
 rationalize what you have?Defining the support model\, tooling and knowled
 ge managementMonitoring and who gets the alerts\; building the escalation 
 modelLifecycle management\; reclaiming resources\, maintenances\, upgrades
 Capacity planning and should you overcommit resources?Who are the customer
 s and how do they interact with the team?

DESCRIPTION:Building an OpenStack private cloud can be very complex. Under
 pinning the entire operational capabilities of your cloud is the Control P
 lane. It's common knowledge you should treat your cloud resources "like ca
 ttle" and not "pets"\, yet most clouds treat the control plane like a favo
 red pet. How should the modern cloud architect choose to design the contro
 l plane aspect of your private cloud?

DESCRIPTION:Cloud-ready apps (cattle) dont need to be migrated\, say visio
 naries. But in the real world\, even cloud-ready apps sometimes do (e.g.\,
  when they live inside tenants upon whose complex configurations they depe
 nd). Meanwhile\, there are still plenty of old-school pet workloads you mi
 ght hope to migrate (instead of torturously rebuilding).This session deep 
 dives into the when\, which and why of migration on OpenStack\, and covers
 :Migration basics: what happens during migrationWhen migration is a good i
 dea (and when it's not)How to judge which workloads are good candidates fo
 r migration (and which are not)How long it takes to migrate and whyAttende
 es will leave more capable of successfully evaluating OpenStack migration 
 projects and workload migration candidates.

DESCRIPTION:How to desigin the architechture of deploying OpenStack in a s
 ingle thoudsand-nodes cluster? How much pressure would basic component suc
 h as database\, messaging queue and loadbalancer encounter?Where is the bo
 ttleneck? Here\, we have built a single 1024-nodes OpenStack cluster which
  contains about 30 controller nodes\,  650 compute nodes\, 250 storage no
 des and 20 network nodes in China Mobile Public Cloud.  We did a lotof pe
 rformance tests as well as recording  the data of each component in deta
 il.  Based on these data\, we did careful analysis and lots of improvemen
 ts.  We share them  to  all OpenStackusers and hope they would help you
  optimize the architecture and improve the performance  in large-sale dep
 loyment!

SUMMARY:High Availability for Pets and Hypervisors - State of The Nation
DTSTART:20160426T204001Z
DTEND:20160426T212041Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:By now\, high availability for the OpenStack control plane is 
 well understood\, and to a large extent a solved problem which the commun
 ity continues to refine.In stark contrast\, most solutions for compute nod
 e HA (i.e. where VMs are automatically restarted on a different compute no
 de if there is a failure in the hypervisor or its underlying hardware) ar
 e still either relatively immature\, experimental\, or in the design phase
 .  This is despite the high demand for this feature\, which calls into 
 question the older belief held by some that OpenStack should only accommo
 date "cattle" VMs which have resilience built in at the application layer.
  In this talk presented by members of the OpenStack HA community who have
  been collaborating on this topic since Tokyo\, we summarise and compare a
 ll known current approaches\, from vendors including Red Hat\, SUSE\, Inte
 l\, NTT\, AWcloud\, ChinaMobile\, and ZeroStack\, and explain the current 
 thinking\, challenges presented\, and future directions.

 many problems in production process. Eg. Ceilometer will take too much ban
 dwidth\, the RabbitMQ could not transmit message promptly\, etc.In this se

DESCRIPTION:Openstack is already an ecosystem designed with microservices 
 in mind. Now its time to start using it is designed. By deploying openstac
 k components with a microservice architecture in mind it will allow you to
  scale\, recover from disasters\, redeploy and upgrade with ease.Container

SUMMARY:Building Real-Time Cloud Using OpenStack

DTEND:20160427T153040Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Users or operators sometimes need to run low-latency or real-t
 ime applications (such as audio/video streaming\, highly interactive syste
 ms\, etc.) to meet their requirements in clouds\, and in fact it seems tha
 t it is one of the reasons why people need to use Ironic on OpenStack\, al
 though Ironic lacks management advantage of virtualization. And a good new
 s is that we have sufficient infrastructure to achieve that in OpenStack (
 in the M release). With these features\, OpenStack can host low-latency or
  real-time applications without using Ironic. However\, its still cumberso
 me to configure and build such real-time clouds.Since we are working on Re
 al-time KVM as one of the projects of KVM enhancements for NFV at OPNFV\, 
 we share our know-how and experiences to build real-time clouds using Open
 Stack.In this session\, we will show how to configure Nova nodes (CPU\, I/
 O\, memory\, etc.) and root-cause potential problems with real-time applic
 ations on OpenStack.

DESCRIPTION:The Open Compute Project (OCP -- opencompute.org) is working t
 owards the open source equivalent of data center hardware including racks\
 , servers\, switches\, and storage. Specifically\, they have created and p
 ublished free-to-use hardware designs and an ecosystem of hardware partner
 s that product the reference designs. OCP designs have been heavily optimi
 zed to reduce purchase (removing redundant components) and operating price
 s (e.g.\, all DC internal power\, simplified FRU structure) and deployed i
 n production at scale by many companies including Facebook.Bringing Open C
 ompute hardware together with OpenStack software is a natural fit\, formin
 g a combination that is open from top to bottom.

DESCRIPTION:In this session\, we will discuss how we build a flexible Open
 Stack cloud from the ground up to support multiple engineering development
  workloads at Intel Open Source Technology Center. We will provide a refer
 ence architecture that includes hardware and software components and recom
 mendation on how to deploy an OpenStack Cloud from scratch\, meeting our f
 lexible compute\, storage and networking requirements. We will share the a
 rchitectural and design decision that we have made in implementing such so
 lution. We will provide insight knowledge and details of the hardware comp
 onents that we have chosen for this cloud\, how to calculate BOM (bill of 
 material)\, operating efficiency (power consumption\, battery backup) \, c
 loud capacity and how this architecture can be scaled from an initial 30 n
 odes cluster to 100+ nodes cluster.

DESCRIPTION:Openstack control services are usually deployed all together o

 e to provide high availability. Swisscom took a different approach and\, e
 mbracing modern distributed application architecture principles\, untangle
 d all the various components into separate and whenever possible horizonta
 lly-scalable entities. This way we reduced complexity of managing larger f
 ail-over clusters\, as well as eased deployment\, maintenance and lifecycl
 e. We will introduce our design\, our reasoning behind the taken approach\
 , as well as dive into some of the problems we encountered and talk about 
 still existing roadblocks for a true cloud-native deployment of OpenStack

  sharded\, which is a special case of horizontally scalable. Along with th

DESCRIPTION:There are always rumors around nova scheduler. Like "Scheduler
  can handle at most 1k nodes without problems" or "I don't believe schedul
 er can handle so much requests using only one tiny process". Some would pr
 efer to launch couples of scheduler instances to multiply the schedule thr
 oughput\, but still others might worry about race conditions and decision 
 conflicts that could outweigh the benefits. Cloud users are interested in 
 the deployment strategies to maximize the schedule performance\, and devel
 opers are curious about the mystery of race condition and its performance 
 impact. Guesses and speculations are everywhere without evidences. So let'
 s do some experiments and let data do the talk!
