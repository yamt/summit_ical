In this session we\u2019ll cover one such approach: a model that covers both the basic infrastructure and the OpenStack services themselves. How? First, we represent distinct actions against our cloud as \u201cverbs\u201d that can be composed into more complex cloud operations. To implement these operations we use Ansible playbooks for a standardized set of reusable templates. We think it\u2019s powerful, and our HPE Helion customers like it too.

While many vendors have focused on the problems of VM Sprawl and the need for thousands of relatively small but high performance Cinder Volumes, very few have focused on the problems of storage for OpenStack applications that create and manage Petabytes of image, video and other large unstructured data objects. Today, a new generation of object storage systems provide the ability for applications in OpenStack environments to access storage over the fast growing AWS S3 interface. This provide advantages and a wide set of advanced storage features including Accounts for multi-tenancy, Buckets with Versioning, Replication and Lifecycle Management (S3). Furthermore,S3 provides an extensive security models for authentication, identity and access management and user policies and integration with Enterprise security services such as LDAP and Active Directory.

In this environment, resources are shared among numerous HANA deployments, with secure network, storage, and access control to ensure the confidentiality of customer data and operations. A custom, in-house baremetal infrastructure lifecycle management solution was created in order to deploy and manage the resources used to deliver these HANA landscapes in the cloud. However, other internal management systems also exist to manage different types of cloud environments, including virtual machines for smaller HANA systems. To consolidate these systems into a single infrastructure and environment, we are beginning to move from a fully in-house solution to a hybrid solution, using OpenStack as a common management framework. The work presented in this document describes our approach to adopting OpenStack within our existing baremetal infrastructure management solution, which will soon be used in production.
