SUMMARY:A Proxy for OpenStack Adoption: Market Trends in Software-defined 
 Infrastructure and Cloud
DTSTART:20160425T204001Z

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:IDC tracks OpenStack developments under the Software-defined I
 nfrastructure market. We have observed how OpenStack has evolved over the 
 years and reached a new level of maturity in 2015. The productization of O
 penStack  delivered as a packaged distribution and now as appliances  will
  push its adoption to new heights. Our studies show how customers are cozy
 ing up to a software-defined infrastructure driven by OpenStack. The prese
 ntation will focus primarily on core infrastructure components viz. storag
 e\, compute and networking and briefly touch upon orchestration. The prese
 ntation will also share results of IDC CloudView survey that shows overall
  cloud adoption trends as well as awareness of open source initiatives.

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack joined together like-minded groups to build private 
 clouds targeting higher value net-new workloads. In an era when private cl
 oud success was low\, early OpenStack implementations saw an unusual level
  of success. Forrester dives into the modern private cloud journey and imp
 act of OpenStack on enterprises journeys. The OpenStack Foundation is one 
 of the first modern open source organizations that seeks to meet even the 
 demands of the Fortune 50 and be the testing ground for emerging standards
 . And although there are many drivers\, leveraging OpenStack's peer-to-pee
 r resource is potentially its greatest.This session will cover the impact 
 and adoption of OpenStack and the organization struggles enterprises face 
 when building private cloud environments. This session also looks at the o
 verall impact of open source movements on larger industry trends such as s
 tandards development.
