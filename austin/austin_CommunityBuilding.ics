DESCRIPTION: The OpenStack community currently has several ways to track 
 requirements and implementation at the project level from blueprints to sp
 ecs to Gerrit\, however it is still fairly difficult to track cross projec
 t needs and user stories (concepts) that require work across multiple proj
 ects and\, potentially\, multiple releases.   In this session\, we will c
 over a need for greater visibility from the Product WG that aligns well wi
 th the general cross-project development tracking needs in the community w
 hich resulted in our project to create a cross-project user story dashboar
 d.   We have started working on a prototype and would be glad to receive 
 feedback\, and assistance\, from the OpenStack development community!  Th
 e session will conclude with a demonstration of our progress thus far.

DESCRIPTION:What happens when you set out to train 100s of new OpenStack c
 ontributors? In the summer of 2015\, we started on that very journey and i
 n this session we will share what wehave learned so far. Intel and Rackspa
 cepartnered together to create an OpenStack Innovation Center. The purpose
  of the Innovation Center is to drive the enterprise adoption of OpenStack
 . One of the 3 strategies for accomplishing this goal was to create adevel
 opment program designed to increase the OpenStack talent pool. In thissess
 ion we will share our lessonslearned whileexecuting on the talent developm
 ent program. We will walkthrough ourrecruitment\, training\, certification
  and mentoring programs. We will talk aboutwhat worked and what didn't. We
  will share stories from recentgraduates of the program and propose ideas

DESCRIPTION:In 2015\, Intel took the chance of sponsoring the 8th Intel-Cu
 p National Collegiate Software Innovation contest in China to promote Open
 Stack by defining the theme to be User Experience Innovation Based on Clou
 d Service. The college students\, who are mainly from school of software a
 nd new to OpenStack\,were required to set up cloud environment on nested v
 irtualization of a rack in a day\, deploy their innovative applications on
  it and then showcase the demonstrations to the judges. However\, we found
  it was not easy for themto deploy OpenStack as their infrastructures of t
 he innovations\, especially for network. We made a survey amongst all the 
 teams\, summarized the feedbacks\, and analyzed the results\, in order to 
 try to find the weaknesses and the reasons why OpenStack is not easy to us
 e to some extent. At the OpenStack summit\, we hope to share those results
  with the audience and think about how OpenStack wins the next generation 
 together with the community.

SUMMARY:Developer Marketing and Relations: Convincing The 'Kingmakers' to 
 Give a Crap About You

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Developers are the new Kingmakers\, but what are the current b
 est and worst practices for developer marketing and relations? Today devel
 opers drive the PoCs and early adoption that make or break your product o
 r service\, and exert a huge amount of influence on the buying process. 
 And once you've made the sale they are the ones you depend on to make sure
  you're a critical piece of your customers' stack. If you're in "cloud" it
 's highly likely that you need to reach developers. The experts on this pa
 nel will tell you how they do it\, complete with stories of things gone w
 rong and gone right. Find out which of the current mediums (blogs\, docs\,
  social media\, conferences\, etc.) are the most effective\, and walk awa
 y with practical\, actionable tips for currying the favor of all those fl
 ip-flop wearing\, overly hair-tinted code monkeys that seem to keep killi
 ng your chance at signing a deal.

DESCRIPTION:Women are half of the population in the world\, but they are s
 till under represented in the tech world industry nowadays. While there ar
 e clear actions in favor of attracting more female developers in order to 
 bring more diversity to the project\, the OpenStack Foundation shows a sim

  Women of OpenStack group in Linkedin with more than 600 members and 137 d
 iscussion. Specific diversity-focused panels during the summits. Women of 
 OpenStack mailing list with close 380 emails in 2015 and 90 different peop
 le commenting and changing ideas [own analysis].This talk will cover the j
 ourney of the OpenStack ecosystem gender diversity since it was born till 
 nowadays. This will focus on the analysis of the code review and code deve
 lopment activity. It is intended to be a quantitative analysis plus specif
 ic manual polishing process to help in the accuracy of the data.
