DESCRIPTION:Increasingly\, enterprises are selecting and implementing clou
 d technologies that best fits their business needs. Much like the evolutio
 n of other utilities\, we are seeing a shift from a vendor-controlled worl
 d to a world where users are choosing open solutions and deciding their co
 nsumption patterns based on the needs of their business. These models leve
 rage their existing IT systems in new ways\, and deliver substantial busin
 ess value on both the new and traditional apps and IT services.  And as e
 nterprises move towards a cloud native application development and a DevOp
 s culture\, the entire application lifecycle is a critical step to provide
  the speed and independence that developers and business units are seeking
 .  Come hear more about  how solutions built across open infrastructure 
 and development platforms are solving Enterprise challenges from Omri Gazi

DESCRIPTION:In this session you will learn how Amadeus IT Group\, a multi-
 national IT provider for global travel and tourism with over 3 billion eur
 o in revenue\, undertook a transformational project to modernize their inf
 rastructure. We will go through some of the drivers for the project ( buil
 ding a new hotel Guest Reservation System using RedHat OpenShift PaaS) and
  technology choices evaluated for the project. You will learn how and why 
 Amadeus chose OpenStack over AWS\, Private Cloud with Chef / Puppet based 
 automation. After deciding to go with OpenStack\, we will go through why 
 Amadeus decided to go with VMware Integrated OpenStack and NSX for this cr
 itical project. We will then share the high level design and best practice
 s Amadeus implemented and learnt from this project.  At the end of this 
 session you will learn how Amadeus has been successful in leveraging OpenS
 tack to support a transformational initiative for the business to support 
 both traditional VM based workloads and new Cloud Native Apps based on Red
 Hat OpenShift PaaS.

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack represents a revolution in agile and efficient publi
 c and private cloud architectures. It is becoming the de facto cloud platf
 orm and organizations are moving a diverse range of both conventional and 
 cloud-native workload onto OpenStack clouds. The infrastructure supporting
  OpenStack cloud needs to be flexibly composed to run optimally for these 
 workloads.In this session\, we introduce Open Composable Network (OCN)\, a
  new way of cloud networking that stemmed from the hyper-scale cloud and w
 eb services giants\, but is being made available widely by Mellanox and ou
 r cloud ecosystem partners. Similar to Lego design\, which use basic compo
 nents with standard interfaces to construct into anything you can imagine\
 , OCN leverages network disaggregation (into basic network building blocks
 )\, open abstraction interfaces\, and automated orchestration and manageme
 nt to turn these building blocks into networks optimally composed to suppo
 rt your unique workload. This new way of cloud networking enables open pla
 tforms to unlock performance and unleash innovation to achieve web-scale e
 fficiency. Our end-to-end 25/50/100G Ethernet and InfiniBand intelligent i
 nterconnect solutions provide unparalleled speeds\, predictable performanc
 e\, and extreme flexibility to compose and recompose software-defined infr
 astructures to meet the needs of cloud-native and enterprise workloads. We
 ll discuss the OCN architecture and share with you real world deployments 
 of our OpenStack customers such as Cambridge\, Enter\, and NCI to showcase
  how these public and private clouds have achieved unmatched OpenStack eff
 iciency and flexibility.

 ew things are falling into place to make Newton a critical development cyc
 le for the OSC team and other projects. i) In the Newton release the keyst
 one team will no longer ship a CLI in keystoneclient [2]\, making OSC a co
 mmon tool for operators\; ii) Missing capabilities for networking and v2 v
 olume support is quickly being added\; iii) Several new projects have crea
 ted or are creating OSC plugins [3]\, and the main issue of commands overl
 apping each other should be caught early by a gate job.With that said\, it
 's not all perfect. The cinder team has brought up some issues [4]\, namel
 y the properties vs metadata naming convention. This issue\, and other con
 ventions the OSC has adopted that divert from the typical CLI usage should
  be addressed now rather than when it is too late. Additionally\, the topi
 c of "when" a team should switch / advertise / deprecate has been brought 
 up many times\, and likely needs consensus and a standardized plan.With al

DESCRIPTION:Session Leader(s): Thomas HerveIn Heat we've been introducing 
 a way to use Zaqar to store events/status updates about stacks. It allows 
 moving away from API-polling on Heat\, using the WebSocket transport in Za
 qar. Using WebSocket also means that integration in web UIs like Horizon i
 s really seamless. I'd like to talk about that approach\, whether or not i
 t can be used in other components\, and if it's practical for cross-compon
 ent communications.The main idea for Nova would be to provide a way to say
 : "Please store the status updates of this server in this Zaqar queue". Af
 terwards\, the various state changes generate messages that the user can r
 etrieve to know where its server is at (in particular ACTIVE\, but error s
 tates are interesting in the long run as well). We need 1) A nice interfac
 e to provide the queue 2) The internal machinery to send the messages (whi
 ch map relatively well to some notifications AFAIU). Heat has environment 
 files where you can easily put that information\, for example.References:

  we move ahead with the constraints system\, because we don't have suffici

 reak a project. As part of my push to remove self-imposed requirements tha

 or co-installability of all services and let each project manage its own v
 ersions of dependendencies and constraints directly by relying on containe
 rs for deployment and/or container-ish things like virtualenvs for our CI 
 testing. However\, I propose that we keep a list of packages allowed to be

 defaults aren't defined separately from policy.json. * It's not possible t
 o determine an exhaustive list of which policies will pass for a request c

 bed defaults in the code and deployers need only configure policies that d
 iffer from these defaults. And policy rules could be linked to 'capabiliti

DESCRIPTION:Session Leader(s): Brant KnudsonKeystone is dropping eventlet 
 support\, so it's not run with keystone-all anymore. Instead it's run in a
  wsgi container. There's lots of options for wsgi containers: mod_wsgi in 
 apache\, uwsgi\, gunicorn. If you run with uwsgi or gunicorn it's typicall
 y fronted with apache or nginx. On top of this\, an advantage to apache/ng
 inx is that you can easily forward requests on different paths to differen
 t servers\, so rather than using ports for each service we can have apache
  accept on port 80 (e.g.\, /identity -> keystone-public\, /identity_admin 
 -> keystone-admin\, /dashboard -> horizon\, /compute -> nova-api\, etc.).D
 evstack also has a tls-proxy config option which is there to put stud in f
 ront of the eventlet servers (because of eventlet server's weak TLS suppor
 t). There's no need for this if we're using apache or nginx since it's got
  strong TLS support.The cross-project request is if we can get other serve
 rs supporting wsgi (use the pbr entrypoint?) and using the same deployment
 .Also\, we need to figure out how to get tempest working with this because
  now it's not. tempest verify-config doesn't get /identity (or /compute) a
 s the unversioned endpoint when the versioned endpoint is /identity/v2.0 (
 it uses / instead). So\, does tempest want to support this configuration\,

DESCRIPTION:Session Leaders: Shamail Tahir\, Carol BarrettIn recent weeks\
 , the Product WG submitted a cross-project specification for rolling upgra
 des which led to a conversation on the difference between specs and guidel
 ines.  We would like to continue this conversation in person and determine
  how the product working group can combine our user story workflow with th
 e cross-project spec approval process.  We would also like to share a demo
 nstration of a cross-project spec/user story tracking dashboard that the t
 eam is building in collaboration with the OpenStack Foundation.  Finally\,
  since our user stories are generated based on market feedback and then sh
 ared in the community\, we would like to brainstorm on how to best help br
 ing feedback from one summit into another once the user and design summits
  are separated.References: - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/290977 - htt

 but heavy penalties if compliance\, regulatory or policy mandates are viol

  a resilient\, persistent storage fully compliant with OpenStack Swift to 
 focus on your application without worrying about the data. Ever wonder wha
 t a persistent SWIFT store would look like? Check out a demonstration of E
 CS\, an object store that works well with Keystone\, S3 and Hadoop. It can
  also replicate across geographies. AND it accepts and translates NFS file

DESCRIPTION:For OpenStack users and developers\, Swift\, Manila and Cinder
  are enough to satisfy data availability and converged infrastructure need
 s. But consider the following scenarios: - You have an existing cloud or v
 irtualization platform\, and you want to add OpenStack to the mix (or vice
  versa). How do you utilize existing storage platforms shared between comp
 ute and orchestration services? - You have existing storage arrays serving
  data to a set of applications\, with policy-based storage management. Wha
 t is the most seamless way to connect to an OpenStack-based cloud with the
  least disruption? In both cases\, it makes sense to utilize a software-de
 fined storage controller that is able to direct storage traffic between st
 orage infrastructure and orchestration platforms\, including OpenStack. In
  this talk\, we'll use the open source CoprHD platform as an example of ho
 w to connect OpenStack with enterprise storage.

 \, high density\, real time and low latency. This hyper-converged architec
 ture has a natural adaptation for NFV\, high end SDS and high performance

 r research and development work that incorporates OpenStack as a foundatio
 n layer for building a big data analytics (BDA) platform. Unlike tradition
 al big data platform that uses HDFS for file and object storage and Ambori
  for monitoring and cluster management\, our BDA platform (codename Bistro
 ) uses OpenStack for file/object storage\, cluster management among other 
 things. In addition\, we will share our experience in developing and deplo

DESCRIPTION:In addition to powering storage clouds from Rackspace\, HP\, a
 nd others\, Swift has long been a repository for Glance images and a targe
 t for backup data. Durability\, scalability\, and global cluster replicati
 on in storage that is accessible by THE industry standard API for storage 
 make Swift deployments applicable to most any cloud environment\, even tho
 se without other OpenStack components. Applications that support the API c
 an run anywhere\, and still get tremendous value from OpenStack.This demo 
 session will show many different applications in many great use cases to h
 ighlight how applicable OpenStack Swift and SwiftStack can be for any Ente
 rprise or Service Provider. Dozens of sponsors at the Summit agree! Not a 
 commercial or product pitch\, this session aims to provide ideas on the wa
 ys that Swift can be used to modernize storage and drive more value from a
 pplications\, from Enterprise Backup to File Sync & Share to Private Cloud
  to large data workflows and more.

DESCRIPTION:Real environments are many times comprised of diverse workload
 s running on diverse infrastructure - from container and database clusters
  and even stateful services such as big data and analytics systems on bare
  metal through non-virtualized and even legacy environments. In order to c
 onnect this new wave of microservices with non-microservices - including e
 verything from setup and provisioning of networking and other complex serv
 ices on any cloud\, hybrid environment support coupled with orchestration 
 through a single pane of glass is simply imperative for such a complex ope
 ration. By fusing the TOSCA standard with best of breed open source toolin
 g and infrastructure\, Cloudify\, coupled with Riemann\, can holistically 
 orchestrate\, auto-scale\, and instrument arbitrarily diverse architecture
 s\, including but not limited to Kubernetes clusters\, Kubernetes microser
 vices\, and non-containerized services on physical and virtual infrastruct
 ure including networking (e.g. Openstack Neutron).By modeling K8S into TOS
 CA it is now possible to easily orchestrate microservices alongside non-mi
 croservices in the same template. This enables you to gather metrics for c
 ontainer images\, and trigger event-driven workflows for auto-scaling and 
 healing with Riemann - both inside and out of K8S\, and all the way throug
 h the entire hybrid deployment - extending to your (more) conventional clo
 ud hosted services such as OpenStack\, AWS\, and Azure.

  as traditional\, walled garden\, yet this paradigm has begun to change si
 nce work started on NFV\, and it is changing fast. The new Telco-Cloud has
  begun to adapt to this strange new world – enabling speedy deployment\,
  cost effective networks\, unheard of agility and most alarmingly of all 
 – openness. Bye-bye lock-in and walled gardens. Say hello to multi-vendo
 r infrastructure. Bye-bye proprietary solutions\, make way for the new kin
 g – Open Source. Nokia CloudBand has been integrating open source code i
 nto its NFV platform from day 1\, little by little overcoming the various 
 pitfalls of using open source in a corporate setting\, and this commitment
  has deepened and flourished\, enabling Nokia CloudBand to work upstream a
 nd initiate project Vitrage\, focusing on the realm of Root Cause Analysis
  and Deduced Alarms. This work is enhanced further by the tight collaborat
 ion with OPNFV and in particular with the Doctor project\, working with DO

DESCRIPTION: General description Glance image sharing has some weirdnesses
  (for example\, the 'visibility=shared' image-list filter that filters on 
 a non-existent visibility value) and some limitations (sharing is one-many
 \, but you must identify each of the many individually).  The community ha
 s discussed implementing "community" images several times in the past\, an
 d there are some detailed design documents.  The aim of this session is to
  verify that the existing design meets current use cases and to get ground
 swell of support going to finally get this done in Newton.  The groundswel
 l has started\, there's already a new spec up. Drivers Brian Rosmaita Nikh
 il Komawar  More about this session  What problem is this trying to solve?
  We propose to extend the current Images v2 image sharing functionality (w
 hich includes an anti-spam provision) to include one-to-all sharing ("comm
 unity" images) while at the same time cleaning up the semantics and some i
 mplementation details of the current scheme.  What's currently out there? 
  Glance has implemented image sharing as defined in the OpenStack Images v
 2 API  What are best practices\, feedback and experiences from cross-prj o
 r other teams?  Don't think any other OpenStack resources are "shareable" 
 in this way.  Feedback has been that for the common use case of an open so
 urce project making an image available to anyone who wants to use it\, the
  current image-sharing scheme is inadequate.  What is the scope of the cur
 rent proposal?  Scope of this session: In addition to discussing the curre
 nt spec and design for Community images\, we'd like to discuss sharing in 
 Glare (the Glance Artifacts Repositiory). Scope of the proposal: Neaten th
 e Glance 'visibility' semantics and add "community" visibility.What has be
 en discussed\, what are/were the blockers and any other reference informat
 ion? This topic has been discussed at previous summits and midcycle meetin
 gs.  The consensus was that we really need to clean up the 'visibility' se
 mantics before adding "community" images\, which makes this a bigger proje
 ct than simply adding one-all image sharing.  References  V2 Community Ima

DESCRIPTION:Topic: Advanced ScalingDriver: HaiweiDescription:1) scaling to
  existing node    For some existing cloud which is not created/managed by 
 Senlin\, if cloud operator wants  to add auto-scaling function or somethin
 g can easily done by Senlin\,Should Senlin support a way to make those nov
 a servers under control of Senlin? This can be done by 'senlin node-create
 -exist --exist-node xxx node_name' by adding an option '--exist-node'.  Th
 e new node can be added to a cluster and controlled by the policies attach
 ed to the cluster. This function may be needed when deploying container cl
 uster in a cloud.    use case: user may want to use Senlin to start contai
 ners in the vms which are created by Magnum( using auto-scaling function)2
 ) semi-autoscalingComplex solutions may require outside intervention/suppo
 rt for making scaling decisions.  For example management approval before s
 caling beyond certain limits.The proposal here is to support notifications
  of scaling events and allow\, properly authenticated\, external services 
 to trigger scaling actions.

 derator: Travis Truman (automagically)Description:A work session to improv

 cal vars that are a hangover from the time before we had config_template. 
 Let's figure out which we can remove and do so. Now that we have a depreca
 tion filter we can make use of that to notify deployers and take them thro
 ugh a deprecation cycle if we feel that's important. The aim is to simplif
 y the roles and reduce technical debt. There is an overwhelming number of 
 task tags assigned between all of the roles involved in OpenStack-Ansible.
  And in some cases\, limiting to one particular tag may not have any subst
 antial outcome. Look into consistency of tagging between roles and trimmin
 g down of existing tags. The intended outcome of this session is to identi
 fy and remove unnecessary deps\, tags and vars\; to design for removing in
 ventory deps\; and to establish a design pattern for role variable namespa

DESCRIPTION:Some deployers of OpenStack and users of large OpenStack cloud
 s want to have their cake and eat it - they want encryption services in th
 e cloud with keys that aren't exposed to the cloud. This is pretty much im
 possible but what can be achieved is minimising the exposure of key materi
 al within cloud operations. Generally speaking BYOK falls into two categor
 ies - "push" and "pull". In a "push" model\, (similar to AWS/Azure) the us
 er may include key material with an API call to perform some function (lik
 e fetch object) and the services will use the provided key to decrypt/encr
 ypt as appropriate. In a "pull" model the OpenStack key manager has a fede
 rated relationship with a remote HSM - they communicate and share keys as 
 appropriate.This session\, along with the Barbican one on BYOK the next da
 y\, should be used to discuss the future of both the "push" and "pull" met
 hods - a good place to start might be capturing concrete use cases.

DESCRIPTION:Cluster-as-a-Service (CaaS) is an innovative concept that empo
 wers end users of an OpenStack private cloud to easily create sophisticate
 d\, isolated\, and secure clustered infrastructure within their private cl
 oud. CaaS deploys a ready-to-use HPC cluster\, preconfigured with all requ
 ired HPC libraries (e.g. MPI\, OpenMP\, CUDA)\, compilers\, workload manag
 ers (e.g. Slurm\, LSF\, Torque\, Grid Engine) and other tools that users n
 eed to quickly start running HPC workloads. HPC is only one application --
  Bright solutions seamlessly deploy Hadoop/Spark\, Ceph\, OpenStack\, and 
 many other clustered environments “as-a-service”.Bright will also demo
 nstrate how its turnkey Bright OpenStack™ platform makes it easier than 
 ever to deploy\, manage\, and monitor OpenStack from a single pane of glas
 s. Leveraging its ten years of experience in deploying\, managing and moni
 toring HPC clusters\, the company will also showcase how Bright OpenStack 
 can be leveraged to spin up HPC and Big Data clusters “as a service” (
 CaaS) inside of an OpenStack private cloud.

DESCRIPTION:In the first part of http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/open
 stack-dev/2016-March/090055.html I laid out an ideal model of how software
  deployments could be used in Heat. We know there is one missing feature p
 reventing this from being easily realisable at the moment: the ability to 
 trigger replacement of a deployment resource depending on which inputs hav
 e changed. Are there any others? Are there any improvements we could make 
 to encourage people to make use of this model? How are users actually usin
 g software deployments in the real world now? What features do they wish H
 eat provided?

DESCRIPTION:Manila needs a grouping construct that\, like shares\, is a 1s
 t-class atomic data type. Our experience with CGs has demonstrated the com
 plexity of adding a grouping capability\, yet there are other use cases su
 ch as migration\, replication\, and backup in which some storage controlle
 rs could only offer such features on share groups. CGs also highlighted th
 e poor optics of an advanced feature with comparatively little potential f
 or vendor support. And adding new grouping constructs for each new feature
  is not technically feasible. All of the above may be addressed by generic
  groups\, which we think is a clean extension to the original architecture
  of Manila.Led by: Clinton Knight

DESCRIPTION:As more organizations embrace cloud technologies\, there has b
 een an increase in attackers targeting cloud deployments. Cyber attackers 
 aggressively pursue crown jewels in a cloud through lateral movement using
  privileged escalations. On an average it takes more than 4 months to dete
 ct an attack. Attack containment and impact estimation are challenging tas
 ks with increasingly complex cloud deployments. Conventional security prod
 ucts can no more keep up with the threat landscape. Organizations must tak
 e an offensive stance to security and they ought to be on-the-hunt to ensu
 re they are protected.In this talk we present how Attivo BOTsink solution 
 detects and contains an attacker who has managed to compromise the weakest
  link in your OpenStack cloud. We will cover some of the key topics includ
 ing:- Learn how a non intrusive solution can go a long way in protection a
 gainst cyber attacks- Learn to use deception to detect an intruder inside 
 your data center or OpenStack cloud- Learn how to use Attivo BOTsink to co
 ntain and neutralize an attack in OpenStack deployment

DESCRIPTION:Currently\, Magnum is using Flannel for providing connectivity
  between containers in different hosts. Flannel is mostly used for overlay
  networking\, and it has significant performance overhead. To improve the 
 performance\, Magnum needs a non-overlay solution to plug containers (runn

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Searchlight dramatically improves the user focused search capa
 bilities and performance on behalf of various OpenStack cloud services. It
  accomplishes this by offloading user search queries from existing API ser
 vers and indexing their data into ElasticSearch.Initial indexing is done o
 n demand\, but keeping the index up-to-date is dependent on notifications 
 from the various services. Right now there are gaps in data and events fro
 m the various services.In a number of places we're forced to hit service A
 PIs in notification handlers because notifications don't contain all the i
 nformation we'd like to index. We've justified this by asserting that the 
 information we get from APIs is necessary to index\, but this has backed u
 s into a corner in some places (notably Nova). We need to decide whether t
 his continues to be OK\, or whether we put more emphasis on improving noti
 fications and/or accepting some data cannot be indexed.We'd ideally like t
 o get contributors from other service teams (Nova\, Neutron\, Cinder\, Gla
 nce\, Ironic\, Magnum\, others) into this room to help understand the Sear
 chlight needs and help us to understand the impact of improving notificati
 on vs API callbacks. This session will include providing a very quick demo
  of searchlight and a brief architectural review for anybody that would li

DESCRIPTION:Title: Deprecate pool groupDescription: Now the relationship b
 etween pool\, pool group and flavor is  pool(N)-- poolgroup(1) -- flavor(1
 )\, so we don't really need the pool group. Because for now\, Zaqar only s
 upports two types of message storage\, redis and mongodb. That said\, ther
 e are only two flavors at most\, one for redis and one for mongodb. Though
  technically\, operator may create more than one pool group for one storag
 e type\, for example\, user(cloud provider) has 10 mongo instances\, they 
 may put 4 instances into mongo-group-1 and put another 6 into mongo-group-
 2. But unfortunately\, in Zaqar's flavor\, only ONE pool gruop can be set.
  And I would admit\, if we remove pool group and let pool map to flaovr di
 rectly\, it's a little bit weird(though i don't know why it's weird :)

 oose amongst several key managers to choosethe one that best fits their ne
 eds. This will allow customers with highly sensitive data to choose a key 
 manager that meets security requirements such as FIPS 140-2 whilecustomers
  with less senstive data can choose a basic software only implementation.B
