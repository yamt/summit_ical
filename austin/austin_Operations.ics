 our Rackspace support engineers will present on four different topics:Trad
 itional linux support vs. OpenStack supportWhat are the diffences between 
 public cloud and private cloud supportWhy so many escalations?  How we im

DESCRIPTION:Have you scripted around making instances expire? Or for the r
 esidual clean-up needed to be done when a tenant is deleted? If so\, this 
 session is for you. In this presentation\, aimed at OpenStack operators\,w
 e  will discuss a new feature beingproposed for Mistral that would allow 
 operators the ability to develop workflows which will run automatically i
 n response to specific OpenStack evens. First\, we will present a brief ov
 erview of Mistral and its capabilities.  Next\, we'll discuss the impleme
 ntation of this new feature and how to write workflows that can use it. As
  a concrete example\, we will show how we added an expiration policy to s
 erver instances by running workflows in response to a server create notifi
 cation. Finally\, we will discuss how this feature can be used to address
  the age old problem of cleaning up resources when a project (tenant) is 
 deleted.

DESCRIPTION:The complex architecture\, design\, and difficulties while tro
 ubleshooting amplifies the effort in debugging a problem with an OpenStack
  environment. This can give administrators and support associates sleeples
 s nights if OpenStack native and supporting components are not configured 
 properly and tuned for optimum performance\, especially with large deploym
 ents that involve high availability and load balancing.We\, being support 
 associates dedicated for OpenStack\, along with system administrators have
  gone through a lot of sleepless nights to chase problems like this. Throu
 ghout this session we will discuss some of those problems in depth\, how w
 e learned to troubleshoot them\, what the root cause was\, and how we arri
 ved at the right solution. Some of these problems are related with scaling
  load balancers that sit in front of API services\, scaling rabbitmq messa
 ge bus\, scaling connections to MariaDB + Galera\, and many more.

 a hypervisors over the network into a stateless live booted operating syst
 em. By using a live operating system\, we separate the stateless operating
  system running in RAM from the Nova configuration and instance data which
  is persistent on disk. Because the OS is an image\, it's easier to jump a
 cross versions as you can load the latest version of the OS by either doin
 g a reboot or a kexec. It also helps maintain consistency and ensures that
  whenever a machine goes down for maintenance or a reboot\, it will come b
 ack on the latest and greatest build. We'll touch on how the OS can be mai

DESCRIPTION:The event logs are usually our best friends for determining wh
 ether a system or its component is experiencing problems. With going away 
 from single node setups we have to say goodbye to finding issues with ease
  just by reading logs here and there. As the number of nodes increase\, it
  becomes painful to track the status of your deployment. Is there anything
  that might help? Yes\, central logging service. With this approach we can
  quickly get answers to “why” and “where” something went wrong\, e
 ven when malfunctioning component is offline\, and there is no way to get 
 to its local storage. But deploying a central logging service might turn o
 ut to be a little hassle itself. Luckily\, you can take advantage of Docke
 r and Ansible in Kolla\, enabling you to have a full centralized logging s
 tack in a matter of seconds. During this presentation we will invite you t

DESCRIPTION:Scheduling is one of the most important components of any Clou
 d deployment. Scheduling means selecting a compute layer based on user's r
 equest and taking into consideration the characteristics of the way the cl
 oud has been setup. OpenStack compute scheduling uses a filtering and weig
 hing mechanism to select a compute to schedule the instance on. Openstack 
 compute scheduling works properly when resources are available to the comp
 ute locally but it can run into various complicated problems when that is 
 not the case or when run at scale.Problems are mentioned below :Compute se
 rvice does not report a holistic view of compute resources. This makes sch
 eduling on those resources impossible.   Compute does not take into cons
 ideration resources exposed via Cinder or Neutron while scheduling.The sch
 eduler lacks global view of resources (especially relevant in heterogeneou
 s clouds).Making the scheduler aware about resource is more of a reactive 
 process than being proactive.In this talk we plan to cover all the above a
 nd many more interesting and scary horror stories about the broken state o
 f OpenStack Scheduling

SUMMARY:Upstream CI/CD Tools for Your Production Clouds That Can Operate 1
 \,000+ Test Cycles in a Day.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:OpenStack QA/Infra projects contain many testing/debugging too
 ls for OpenStack development. These tools are designed/developed for upstr
 eam development mainly\, but we can use them for production clouds also. F
 or example\, Tempest(Integration test suite) is maintained for production 
 clouds also\, and we can continueusing the same Tempest for multiple OpenS
 tack versions(like Kilo\, Liberty\, latest). In addition\, we are using op
 enstack-health dashboard for knowing test success/failure situation and Ki
 bana for debugging.If using these tools efficiently\, you can verify your 
 production clouds when deploying\, upgrading and switching.However\, it is
  difficult to use these tools for production clouds because the numbers of
  tools' configuration options arehuge(e.g. 300+ options in Tempest) and th
 e default values of these options are optimized for the upstream developme
 nt.In this session\, we'd like to talk about how to use these tools for pr
 oduction clouds.

SUMMARY:Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires -  A Proactive Approach to Monit
 oring Your OpenStack Cloud

DESCRIPTION:When the alarms go off and it's your responsibility to solve a
  problem with your cloud\, it's important to have visibility into your dep
 loyment. What if it was possible to see the problems before they happened?
  What if it was possible to solve the next issue before the alarm goes off
  or a customer reports an issue? Over the past eight months\, Time Warner 
 Cable has been using theMonasca project for alerting\, capacity planning\,
  problem prediction\, and trend analysis. This talk will cover how we've g
 one from reactive to proactive\, the challenges along our way\, and how yo
 u can do the same.

DESCRIPTION:Member or admin.  Do you still only have two roles in your cl
 oud?  Implementing Role Based Access Controls sounds so easy\, but how do
  you do it without disrupting your users? Well\, we made the jump with alm
 ost no impact.Modifying roles in a production environment is a journey fra
 ught with peril and screams of horror.  From starting with the community 
 policies through deploying custom roles\, we will guide you through:Concep
 tualizing what authority levels should be requiredVisualizing authorities 
 throughout the environmentSolving the “everyone’s an admin” problemD
 iscovering dependencies between OpenStack servicesWorking around Keystone 
 domains vs. ignorance of domainsPlanning compartmentalized deploymentsModi
 fying Horizon for new rolesImplementing backwards compatibilityDeploying n
 ew policiesCleaning up after yourselfAfter this talk\, you’ll be well pr
 epared to proceed safely with your RBAC implementation.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:The challenge of managing physical hardware can be simplified 
 using Ironic bare-metal provisioning\, decreasing workload deployment time
 . In this session\, we will address the need for self-service and its bene
 fits over submitting tickets. We’ll also discuss typical data center/inf
 rastructure integration use cases.We discuss:- What Ironic is and how it w
 orks- Benefits of using Ironic compared to other provisioning tools- Chall
 enges and "missing parts" you can encounter using Ironic in production env
 ironments\, such as:  rack-level awareness for networking (i.e.\, availab
 ility zones for networks)\; DNS integration\; hardware RAID configuration 
 (e.g.\, extended Ironic Python Agent functionality)\; server name generati
 on- Operational issues such as data center networking to accommodate Ironi
 cIronic is perceived by many as being immature\, since there is a lack of 
 notable experience in using Ironic in production\, especially at scale but
  we’ll share real world large-scale production experience.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:As any OpenStack operator knows a straightforward request\, su
 ch as creating a VM\, requires multiple services to successfully communica
 te with each other and perform a designated function. When this doesnt go 
 to plan there are a number of potential log files to analyze\, each potent
 ially supplying a piece of the puzzle.This talk will provide knowledge on 
 how an operator who has minimal experience of the Python programming langu
 age can extract the information they need to root cause and resolve issues
 .
