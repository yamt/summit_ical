DESCRIPTION:This talk will focus on the evolving requirements of current a
 nd future Telco Cloud deployments.Network Functions are widely deployed to
 day with quantified performance\, failure and capacity requirements. As th
 ose functions make their way to a Telco Cloud\, it is clear that various c
 haracteristics are required of the Cloud to preserve the brown field migra
 tion of these functions.Requirements of Telco Cloud deployments range from
 high availability and liveness detection of network connectivity (PING\, B
 FD\, TCP Socket Level Checks\, etc.)\, preserving existing network reachab
 ility with protocols such as BGP\, marking tenant workloadpackets with cor
 rect QOS values\, high I/O performance characteristics with SR-IOV/DPDK\, 
 etc.The Telecom/NFV track is brought to you by OpenStack and OPNFV.

DTEND:20160427T153040Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Service chaining plays an important role in network function v
 irtualization by stitching together an ordered list of virtual network fun
 ctions\, such as routers\, firewalls\, load balancers etc.\, to achieve a 
 particular complex service that previously required multiple physical appl
 iances. This presentation will review and analyze two major technologies t
 hat enable service function chaining\, i.e. NSH-based SFC and BGPVPN-based
  SFC\, followed by current status of various projects addressing SFC\, MPL
 S / BGP VPN\, and related APIs in OPNFV\, OpenStack and Open Daylight. Las
 tly\, this presentation will also review a prior PoC that implemented inte
 r-DC SFC using BGPVPN technology.The Telecom/NFV track is brought to you b

DESCRIPTION:Network applications want to take advantage of the elasticity\
 , cost savings\, increased efficiency that Network Functions Virtualizatio
 n (NFV) offers them. However\, NFV still needs to provide Telco-grade serv
 ices\, including offering their end-users with SLAs of Five-nine availabil
 ity or higher\, which means that the network must be available 99.999% of 
 the time or be down less than 5.25 minutes a year. Virtualization and clo
 uds\, while promising significant advantages through agility and cost savi
 ngs\, bring challenges in providing carrier grade resiliency. One way to a
 chieve the desired Five-nine availability in an OpenStack based cloud is t
 o have the Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) leverage the OpenStack Constru
 cts in an intelligent manner. This presentation will provide recommendati
 ons as to how VNFs can leverage existing OpenStack constructs in an effici
 ent manner. It will also identify the new OpenStack Constructs required\, 
 if any\, to enable high availability. The Telecom/NFV track is brought to

DESCRIPTION:Today\, OpenStack schedules each virtual machine and volume al
 most in isolation. However\, cloud applications can consist of many VMs an
 d volumes with potentially complex requirements around relative placement.
  Meeting these requirements requires that holistic placement decisions be 
 made in consideration of the entire cloud application.In this talk\, we wi
 ll present our proof of concept work\, Valet. It gives OpenStack the abili
 ty to meet an application's requirements while optimizing cloud resources 
 and maximizing the use of available infrastructure. It accomplishes this t
 hrough the use of Heat\, Nova\, and Cinder plugins\, coupled with a new op
 timization plugin architecture. The Telecom/NFV track is brought to you b

  in OpenStack and Open Daylight\, and a novel use case of supporting the c
 apability of an IPv6 vRouter on a VM in OpenStack + Open Daylight environm
 ent. The VM is capable of (1) advertising IPv6 Router Advertisements (RA) 
 to the VMs on the internal network\; and (2) IPv6 Forwarding (i.e.\, North
 -South traffic). This novel use case expands IPv6 vRouter capability to an
 y VM and allows for any 3rd-party solution\, e.g. IPv6 vRouter VNF\, as an
  alternative of Neutron Router or ODL Router. Thus it enables open innovat
 ion. Various aspects in deployment\, configuration\, operation\, and the p

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:High service availability is an integral part in mobile core n
 etwork. As each core node hosts few hundred thousand subscriber sessions\,
  a sub-second level fast recovery is necessary not only to ensure seamless
  connectivity to the customers\, but also to avoid the consequent attach s
 torm where all disconnected mobile devices try to reconnect to the mobile 
 network simultaneously\, creating control traffic beyond what a node can h
 andle. In NFV-based networks\, recovery actions will be performed by a nod
 e manager which cannot directly detect virtualized network infrastructure 
 level failures. Therefore\, OpenStack needs to detect and notify the corre
 sponding node manager of relevant resource failure. An additional requirem
 ent is the filtering of the failures\, as the definition of failure and th
 e operational policy may differ among Operators.Well introduce a solution 
 using Congress and extended features to meet these telco requirements\, as
  well as PoC developed with OPNFV Doctor Project.The Telecom/NFV track is

 rt etc. In the M release\, the real time support is also added to Nova. Wi
 th all these features\, openstack can provide best performance optimizatio
 n for high performance VM\, with exclusively assigned resource and best ha
 rdware compute capability utilization.In this session\, we will show how t
 he advanced openstack features help on an important usage scenario\, the l
 ow latency and high throughput NFV. It has been challengingto achieve low 
 latency and high performance VNF on cloud environment. Packet jitter comes
  from various factors\, like virtualization overhead\, not optimized compu
 te node environment\, not optimized network topology overhead etc. KVM4NFV
  project on OPNFV provides low level support for low latency NFV usage\, b
 ut only with the advanced openstack features\, its possible to achieve the
  purpose on OPNFV.The Telecom/NFV track is brought to you by OpenStack and
  OPNFV.

DESCRIPTION:OPNFV has just released Brahmaputra which is the first major v
 ersion. Openstack is the dominant component in OPNFV. But what does that m
 ean? Which OpenStack modules are the important ones within OPNFV and why a
 re they chosen? Which components did OPNFV add to OpenStack when building 
 up its architecture? This session will provide some insights how OPNFV is 
 using OpenStack and how OpenStack modules need to interwork with other com
 ponents to create a carrier platform for NFV. The Telecom/NFV track is br
 ought to you by OpenStack and OPNFV.
