DESCRIPTION:Mark is a long-time open-source practitioner and advocate. Ale
 xis is a long-time Agile practitioner and advocate. In recent times\, they
  find each other working very closely together\, searching for ways to hel
 p Red Hats OpenStack team continuously improve its way of working.Mark wil
 l spend some time describing his view of the key abstract ideas and princi
 ples that should influence the thinking of those leading\, or contributing
  to\, open-source projects. Alexis will spend a similar amount of time tal
 king about the abstract ideas and principles from the Agile\, DevOps\, Con
 tinuous Delivery\, and Lean movements that every software project should d
 raw from.Together they will draw some conclusions relevant to the OpenStac
 k community in general\, but particularly relevant to those who wish to bo
 th contribute to and build upon OpenStack. They expect this will contribut
 e to an ongoing conversation to improve the way individuals and companies 
 are contributing to the success of OpenStack.

DESCRIPTION:Since OpenStack is growing in terms of code\, users and number
  of projects\, experts from SUSE working upstream on OpenStack believe tha
 t its a good idea to share our experience with the OpenStack community. We
  would like to give tips and pointers and help new projects to create a ne
 w project in OpenStack.

SUMMARY:A Cloudy Forecast - Contributing Platform Drivers to Upstream Open
 Stack
DTSTART:20160425T190019Z

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack was designed and built for cloud deployments\, but m
 any existing platforms in today's data centers were deployed more traditio
 nally. With many operators working towards converged cloud infrastructure\
 , integrating these platforms is key to simplifying existing data centers.
  Fortunately OpenStack supports an extensible driver model allowing vendor
 s to contribute support for their platforms upstream. In this talk we'll d
 iscuss our experience contributing support for a traditional platform to u
 pstream OpenStack and talk about the challenges and rewards along the way.

SUMMARY:Want to be an OpenStack Intern?

DESCRIPTION:Internship programs like Outreachy and Google Summer of Code o
 ffer focused internship opportunities with a number of free software organ
 izations. OpenStack\, being one of the biggest open source organization\, 
 plays a big role in these programs by funding and mentoring contributors. 
 Programs like Google Summer of Code are open internationally to students a
 nd Outreachy is open to women and other underrepresented groups in free an
 d open source. This session hopes to demystify the process of contributing
  to OpenStack and spread awareness of the programs available to those who 
 are looking to start their careers in OpenStack and open source. As former
  interns\, we will share our experience and help the attendees to understa
 nd the application process and flow of any open source project.

SUMMARY:From Upstream Documentation To Downstream Product Knowledge Base

DESCRIPTION:How the documentation maintained by the OpenStack Docs team is
  used at DreamHost in a modern knowledge base. The DreamHost Community Tea
 m has designed a process and tools to semi-automatically pull from OpenSta
 ck upstream documentation and manuals\, slightly modify the documentation 
 to adapt the content to their needs and publish it on a Knowledge Base\, p
 owered by Zendesk. The end result are pages that allow gathering immediate
  feedback from readers and stimulate conversations on the pages themselves
 . The data gathered over time on the DreamHost Knowledge Base will be shar
 ed back with the OpenStack upstream community to help orient upstream effo
 rts.

SUMMARY:Life on OpenStack Outside The Kernel

DESCRIPTION:A great part of the OpenStack community\, according the last u
 ser survey\, is based mostly in the developed regions\, like North America
  (44%)\, Europe (22%)\, and Japan (6%). However\, there is still a big  p
 art of the community not located at those regions. Non-kernel countries th
 at belong to the called third world\, like Brazil\, India\, South Africa a
 nd others are getting more involved in the community. The road for this in
 volvement is not always easy. Those countries are behind the others in som
 e aspects\, like (i) Summit and Midcycle meetup: It’s expensive to atten
 d when you live thousands of miles from the places and your country does n
 ot have a strong currency\; (ii) Language\, for non-native english speaker
 s\; (iii) timezone shifts\, if the meeting happens when you’re usually a
 sleep\, among other problems. In this talk\, we’ll show how we\, a coupl
 e of brazilians have overcome those issues during our OpenStack journey an
 d have achieved a good place with contributions in the community.

DESCRIPTION:Becoming part of the OpenStack developers' team is a complex c
 hallenge where knowing how to deal with source code is just one skill to b
 e good at.When you're trying to find your way and add new functionality to
  projects like Nova or Neutron you have a lot to learn not just about the 
 code base\, but the community culture and the people you are working with.
  Communication and timing become even more important\, when you have multi
 ple projects to land code into in order to be able to implement cross-proj
 ect features.This session will guide you through the steps you need to tak
 e after reading the getting started guide to become a good community citiz
 en and later on a team member. You will learn how this community works fro
 m the insights including principles\, best practices and unwritten rules.

DESCRIPTION:Many of us\, developers/individual contributors\, work for a v
 endor\, operator\, or academic/research organization which has a significa
 nt role in the OpenStack ecosystem. We often face the challenge of managin
 g our time and effort between the community work and our day job\, as well
  as striking a balance or aligning our community work with our employers g
 oals and objectives in OpenStack.This is a panel with developers/individua
 l contributors\, managers\, PTL\, TC to discuss their experiences and prov
 ide recommendations on how to effectively contribute to the community whil
 e meeting our employers' goals and objectives in OpenStack.This panel will
  facilitate communication and generate mutual understanding between develo
 pers/individual contributors and managers\, and hopefully inspire employer
 s to modify their R processes and create the right KPIs to enable their de
 velopers/individual contributors to succeed in both OpenStack community an
 d their day job.
