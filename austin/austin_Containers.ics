DESCRIPTION:Many organizations have had success dabbling with with Linux C
 ontainers. Once you take a small project and have success\, the epiphany h
 appens - and you ask yourself: 1. What else can we containerize? 2. Can we
  put everything in containers? 3. How do we get traditional applications i
 nto containers? Virtual Machines aren't going anywhere and applications ma
 de up of Containers and Virtual Machines are becoming the norm.

DESCRIPTION:Kuryr was unveiled in the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo.Its goal i
 s to make Neutron networking available to containainers in their most wide
 spread usages.Kuryr's aim\, as we move towards the N release\, is to bridg
 e the gap between the container orchestration engines like Kubernetes and 
 OpenStack networking models and expose all of the production grade Neutron
  capabilities and services to big scale container consumers.In this sessio
 n we will talk about how Kuryr bridged the gap with Docker standalone conf
 igurations\, how it brings networking to Docker Swarm and what is the road
 map for the next release.

SUMMARY:Mesos and OpenStack: The Perfect Tag Team for Containers

DESCRIPTION:Container Orchestration Engines such as Kubernetes and Swarm p
 rovide full management for containers\, however they assume that the clus
 ter infrastructure is provided by someone else. OpenStack provides the fu
 ll infrastructure and Magnum integrates these resources for the Container
  Orchestration Engine\, but the resource management is left to the users.
  Mesos on the other hand provides advanced\, highly scalable resource ma
 nagement.Recent development allows Kubernetes and Swarm to run on Mesos as
  frameworks. This makes it now possible to bring the 3 layers together to
  achieve a new level of integration and automation\, yielding many benefi
 ts: scaling at both the container and the node level\, fine grained resou
 rce sharing among clusters\, etc.In this talk\, we will take a close look
  at running Kubernetes and Swarm workloads on Mesos\, hosted on OpenStack
 . We will show the necessary plumbing for the integration\, and discuss p
 otential issues in providing networking and storage through Mesos.

SUMMARY:Multi-tenancy for Docker Containers With Keystone\, and Adding Quo
 ta Limits
DTSTART:20160427T145000Z
DTEND:20160427T153040Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Docker containers need multi-tenancy feature with keystone whi
 ch will help to isolate the containers for different users and tenants. Mu
 lti tenancy will avoid users invading other users' containers\, since th
 e containers owned will be invisible to other tenants or users except the
  admin or the owner of the containers.The proposed approach enables the 
 organization administrator to specify quota limits through keystone ensuri
 ng budget targets are adhered to in a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Use key
 stone to validate the identity of a user's username-password\, API key or 
 authentication token.Proposal is to create a new authentication plugin to
  talk to keystone and validate the user's credentials.This security featur
 e allows secure communications between containers. The private networking 
 enables open connectivity within the environment deployed by a given user.

DESCRIPTION:Everyone loves containers\, but nobody wants to talk about the
  elephant in the room - how can you make storage persist when the whole po
 int of containers is that they have short lifespans? In this presentation 
 we'll discuss how to use the REX-Ray volume driver\, backed by Cinder\, to
  provide persistent\, preemptable storage to Docker container servers host
 ed on OpenStack.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:On its journey to become an integration engine of cloud techno
 logies\, OpenStack has been actively incubating many technologies related 
 to containers. However\, containers are yet to be treated as first class c
 itizens on OpenStack. In other words\, it may not be sufficient to just br
 idge the existing OpenStack services to other container technologies.In th
 is talk\, the presenters will share their visions and experiences on manag
 ing container clusters directly using OpenStack native services. The goal 
 of the work is to explore the feasibility to treat containers as first cla
 ss citizens in OpenStack rather than above OpenStack. A comprehensive supp
 ort to containers will help ease the development\, testing\, deployment an
 d management of containers considering that\, for example\, users have to 
 work with Python\, Go\, Java\, C\, Scalar code in different projects.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:In the OpenStack ecosystem\, containers were introduced as fir
 st class citizens recently with the project Magnum and the networking for 
 containers has also evolved since then. Project Kuryr makes networking ava
 ilable to containers through Neutron. This all brings together how Neutron
  networking benefits containers like it does virtual machines. However\, t
 o make Neutron\, Kuryr and Magnum cover all the use cases for containers\,
  nested containers inside Nova VMs require networking to work as seamlessl
 y as it works for virtual machines or bare metal containers. In this sessi
 on\, we will talk about Magnum\, Kuryr\, Neutron integration and how the p
 roblem of nested container networking has been solved in the OpenStack com
 munity\, it's architecture\, the design\, current status and next steps.

SUMMARY:Kubernetes Automation on OpenStack Using Ansible

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes is a popular platform for deploying\, scaling and m
 anaging microservices due to its ease of use and application centric archi
 tecture. However\, if you are looking to kick the tires with docker+kubern
 etes on OpenStack using nova instances and neutron overlay networking\, yo
 u will soon find that there are very few resources available in terms of d
 ocs\, automation and code.We realized this issue when we started exploring
  for resources to build our private kube cluster for one of our internal
  POCs. Eventhough the Magnum service is available\, we did not use it in
  our test environment as it lacked hybrid cloud and many of our customers 
 preferred deploying docker+kubernetes natively without the management com
 plexity of Magnum. We have since spent time developing the required auto
 mation in ansible to launch repeatable kubernetes clusters in openstack fr
 om a cloud yaml spec. This talk will the present the details of the work w
 e have done and lessons learned and strategies employed.

DESCRIPTION:Containers are fast becoming the standard unit of deployment 
 for cloud-native applications that follow the design patterns of a "Twelv
 e-Factor App". Two of those patterns talks about stateless application p
 rocesses and about backing services.  Application data that needs to pe
 rsist is typically written to a backing service such as a database and the
 se types of use-cases is where the topics of data persistence and containe
 rs meld.In this session\, we will start from the beginning by reviewing wh
 y/when containers might be a good fit with your OpenStack cloud strategy f
 ollowed by how OpenStack Cinder can be used with containers (along with ex
 amples when it shouldn't be) and\, finally\, a review of the orchestration
  tools available for leveraging persistent storage provided by OpenStack C
 inder with containers along with a demonstration.

DESCRIPTION:In the data center OS model\,DCOS behaves like the Operating S
 ystem\,managing hardware resources and providing that information to appli
 cation frameworks to schedule tasks across dozens or thousands of machines
 . Due to the benefits of container\,it can realize the elastic extension a
 t application-level truely.Our DCOS is a software stack consisting of meso
 s\,kubernete\,marathon\,etcd.so we can supply more perfect features.The ar
 thitecture is made up of cloud-provider layer\, core layer and manager Lay
 er.Cloud-provider layer can support three types of resurces: bare-metal ma
 chine\,public and private cloud.Perhaps we can provide real hybrid-cloud a
 t paas level in the future.The core layer consists of task scheduler servi
 ce(based mesos)\, framework auto-deployment service(based marathon)\,task 
 discovery and registration service(etcd and haproxy).We can integrate clou
 d framework and bigdata framework into one platform.The manager layer  i
 s aim to provide a friendly dashboard.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Initial cloud designs were based upon the assumption that hard
 ware emulation via the hypervisor was to be the most significant building 
 block of cloud compute infrastructure. Many of those clouds were built wit
 hout a workload in mind\, and with an if you build it they will comemental
 ity. They often failed to show value to the business. With the emergence o
 f containerization\, rich orchestration like Kubernetes and container opti
 mized operating systems\, rather than bringing workloads to the cloud\, we
  can bring the cloud to the workloads. The benefits of orchestrated contai
 ner based cloud approaches are manifold  workloadsare portable between clo
 uds\, clouds can quickly be built using existing bare metal\, legacy virtu
 alization or next generation cloud providers like OpenStack\, Microsoft Az
 ure or Amazon AWS. Further integration of DevOps via PaaS only serves to e
 nhance the organizational benefit of the non-disruptive hybrid cloud appro
 ach.

DESCRIPTION:The technology industry has been abuzz about cloud workload co
 ntainerization since the open source Docker project became a phenomenon in
  early 2014. Meanwhile\, an OpenStack Containers Team was formed and the 
 Magnum project launched to provide users with a convenient Containers-as-a
 -Service solution for OpenStack environments. As the potential of both te
 chnologies emerged\, many wanted to see shared governance over the baselin
 e container specification and runtime technology to ensure an open cloud e
 cosystem. This past December\, two new groups were launched with a goal o
 f creating open\, industry standards. The first called the Open Container 
 Initiative (http://www.opencontainers.org)\, and the second called the Clo
 ud Native Computing Foundation (http://cncf.io)

DESCRIPTION:OpenStack users who want to create and manage container enviro
 nments (e.g.\, Kubernetes\, Docker Swarm\, Apache Mesos\, etc.) can do so 
 with methods native to each solution’s ecology. They can explore OpenSta
 ck Magnum’s API\, which enables creation of Kubernetes\, Swarm or Mesos 
 environments\, plus abstract management of container workloads. Or they ca
 n use Murano\, the application catalog\, which deploys Kubernetes clusters
 \, pods\, and container applications with Wizard ease.Which to choose? Thi
 s session will describe:Magnum and Murano: Intentions\, features\, workflo
 wTrade-offs in control vs. convenience\, and their significance...And disc
 uss the state of current work aimed at making Magnum deployable and callab
 le by Murano\, making Magnum more accessible to less-technical users\, and
  broadening the suite of container solutions Murano can catalog and deploy
 . Attendees will leave this session with better understanding of options f
 or container-environment deployment within OpenStack.

DESCRIPTION:Containers quickly rose in popularity among developers with st
 andardization driving portability\, and have led to new micro-segmented so
 ftware architectures providing agility for solving large distributed compu
 ting tasks\, such as big data analytics or motion picture rendering. What 
 is the proper role for containers in the data center today? Do they become
  peers with virtual machines and bare metal computing and managed by the s
 ame platforms? Will they be deployed on all devices\, such as servers\, ne
 twork adapter cards\, network devices\, etc? This panel will discuss the r
 ole containers will assume in the data center and how this important techn
 ology integrates with existing infrastructure in 2016 and beyond.

DESCRIPTION:As our development projects grew\, and our team more distribut
 ed\, we needed a better way to onboard new developers\, consistently deplo
 y new environments\, and predictably test subcomponents.To solve our requi
 rements\, we turned to containers in order to manage each component and or
 chestrate the full application stack. Although there is a moderate learnin
 g curve for new team members\, these tools have given us a huge benefit in
  lowering the level of effort for each development iteration\, vastly incr
 eased reproducibility\, and have radically simplified the ease in product 
 installation.In this session\, we will walk attendees through our developm
 ent and deployment lifecycle using Docker containers deployed into an Open
 Stack cloud. We will describe how each stage has been improved\, the chall
 enges we encountered\, and the solutions that weve implemented.
