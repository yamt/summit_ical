DESCRIPTION:Currently\, the no.1 problem facing OpenStack developers is th
 e "cambrian explosion" in cloud application paradigms (Containers\, SDKs\,
  APIs\, VMs\, Orchestration... oh my!). DevOpps and AppDev communities hav
 e significantly different views on the ways in which to develop cloud apps
 \, let alone *what* a 'cloud app' is?!.The community needs a place to lear
 n about each other's cloud application techniques.Â This workshop will bri
 ng together coders who are responsible for training new users in cloud app
 lication paradigms. This community will be focused on helping the humans w
 hom live outside of the OpenStack community and are looking for how best t
 o host their apps on OpenStack.People who should attend this workshop:Staf
 f responsible for providing training on how to use / deploy / create apps 
 on OpenStack\, i.e. Mirantis DevOpps showing their customer AppDev how to 
 deploy apps.External cloud app developer communities\, i.e. Ruby AppDev lo
 oking to deploy their apps via Fog on AWS\, Azure and Rackspace.Legacy and
  enterprise app developers\, i.e. cloud aware apps utilising APIs to bridg
 e scalable cloud compute/data services.Container developers\, i.e. CoreOS/
 Docker applications being orchestrated by K8S.Any technically savvy person
  who like to help other learn about cloud apps\, i.e. DevOpps who speak Ap
 pDev\, and vice versa.Objectives (by the end of this workshop you will kno
 w how to...):Run cloud application training which utilises best practice i
 n learning science (aka pedagogical intelligences[1])\, i.e. friends don't
  let friends kill each other with powerpoint.Provide a training forum wher
 e multiple developers audiences (SysAdmin\, DevOpps\, AppDev\, TestEng & U
 Xer) can learn and train one another about good practice in cloud applicat
 ions.Craft learning challenges (problem-sets) for varying skill levels and
  cloud application paradigms: cloud native apps (containers\, docker\, cor
 eos)\, cloud aware apps (ProgLang specific SDKs\, LibCloud\, jCloud\, Fog\
 , etc.)\, cloud organic apps (APIs\, VMs\, etc.) and orchestrating cloud a
 pps (HeAT\, K8S\, Swarm\, Rkt\, etc).Share cloud application learning chal
 lenges in a fun and community driven way so that all can benefit from bett
 er cloud application development.Outline of this training avaialble here:
