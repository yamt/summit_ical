 penstackfoundation.formstack.com/forms/mentoringUpstream University is an 
 intensive program designed to help new contributors learn how to effective
 ly work upstream\, by fixing bugs and getting their features accepted into
  the OpenStack project. The educational program requires students to work 
 on real-life bug fixes or new features during two days of real-life classe
 s and online mentoring\, until the work is accepted by OpenStack. The live
  two-day class teaches them to navigate the intricacies of the projects te
 chnical tools and social interactions. In a followup session\, the student
 s benefit from individual online sessions to help them resolve any remaini
 ng problems they might have.Make sure to book your travel plans to arrive 
 in Austin Friday evening or Saturday morning in order to attend the full t
 wo-day training session.

SUMMARY:Speed Mentoring\, Organized by The Women Of OpenStack 
DTSTART:20160425T120000Z
DTEND:20160425T134500Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:RSVP Required. Breakfast and coffee will be provided.Update:
  At this time we are full for mentors for this event! If you want to sign
  up as a mentor\, we can put you on a waiting list. Or\, you could sign up
  as a mentee instead and maybe meet someone with expertise in a different 
 area.In addition to the RSVP link below please also complete the general m
 entoring questionnaire here - https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/fo
 rms/mentoring.This is like speed dating\, where mentees will have five-to-
 10 minutes to talk to potential mentors\, then cycle throughout the room 
 for about an hour-and-a-half. At the end\, people will fill out surveys w
 ith their preferences and we'll contact people about potential matches. 
 We're hoping to do this at the beginning of the Summit\, so hopefully men
 tors and mentees can have some face to face time throughout the week.The n
 ew mentoring program sponsored the Women of OpenStack is designed to be a
  lightweight mentoring initiative to provide technical or career guidance
  to beginners in the community.  Mentees should already be part of the co
 mmunity\; they should have gone through\, or be familiar with the Upstrea
 m Training.Technical mentoring doesn't just mean coding\, we're looking f
 or people who are a specialist in any area of OpenStack - for example doc
 s or marketing.  Technical mentors and mentees should expect to spend ab
 out an hour a week talking about projects to get involved in\, people to
  meet\, anything to help their mentees get to their next step. Career me
 ntors could be in a completely different area of OpenStack from their men
 tees.  They should expect to spend about an hour a month with their ment
 ees offering more general career guidance\, maybe helping their mentees m
 ake connections in the community.

SUMMARY:Evolving Virtual Networking with IO Visor
DTSTART:20160425T195000Z
DTEND:20160425T203000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:As virtual network functions increasingly run on compute nodes
 \, having efficient monitoring to manage the health of virtual networks ha
 s become a key requirement. Traditional monitoring methods are no longer s
 calable in distributed data plane models and new methods must be developed
  to offer greater scale without compromising programmability and flexibili
 ty. Using IO Visor\, high performance monitoring can be achieved for opera
 tions and management. Join the session to find out about IO Visor and how 
 it can be used for scalable monitoring of virtual network functions. The t
 alk will also cover using IO Visor to evolve Virtual Network data plane an
 d to enable hardware accelerations.

SUMMARY:Using IO Visor to Secure Microservices Running on Cloud Foundry
DTSTART:20160425T204000Z
DTEND:20160425T212000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:As microservices grow\, traditional firewall rules based on ne
 twork ACLs are no longer scalable and fall short of providing fine-grained
  enforcement. Group Based Policy (GBP) is a flexible policy language that 
 allows users to specify policy enforcement based on intent\, independent o
 f network infrastructure and IP addressing. Using micro-segmented virtual 
 domains\, administrators can define policies at a centralized location and
  use IO Visor technology for distributed enforcement. This provides infras
 tructure independent rules\, template-based policy definitions\, and scale
 -out policy enforcement for a solution that secures and scales with micros
 ervices. This session will be presented by members of the IO Visor communi
 ty and will cover how IO Visor technology can be used to define and enforc
 e GBP. The discussion will also cover using GBP for cloud foundry applicat
 ion spaces where microservices are deployed and need scalable\, efficient 
 security policies.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:This session is a discussion of ways to resolve a problem with
  single sourcing using Sphinx. How would you single source your documentat
 ion without a content management system that most of the technical publish
 ing world uses? What if your content lives in separate repositories? How c
 an you apply conditions using Sphinx?This use case will explain:What is si
 ngle sourcing in technical writing?What are the possible workarounds to ad
 dress the needs of TechPubs departments using Sphinx?How to conditionalize
  the outputOther open-source documentation alternativesSingle sourcing is 
 the concept of optimizing technical content reuse with multiple deliverabl
 es from a single source. Most OpenStack contributors use Sphinx and RST\, 
 so contributors are interested in leveraging all benefits of the tool. Con
 figuring Sphinx so it addresses the needs of a Technical Publication depar
 tment is crucial\, so many OpenStack contributors will be interested in fi
 nding out about ways to better use Sphinx.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:As a first step of collaboration OPNFV has started to bring fe
 ature requests and implementation into OpenStack inorder to accelerate the
  evolution of NFV with using OpenStack as cloud platform. To move forward 
 and improve the co-operation between these two communities further synchro
 nization is needed on the roadmaps and between the developer communities.W
 e will discussthe possibilities of sharing tool chains and ideas used for 
 testing and generating documentation. And going even further OPNFV has eve
 n more to offer with its test frameworks and labs that can provide end to 
 end testing for functionalities on a fully integrated platform with differ
 ent storage and SDN controller options to choose from.Currently we don't h
 ave a method to verify and validate features under development. We believe
  solving this issue can be highly beneficial for both communities and neve
 rtheless would strongly improve collaboration\,so this is what we are look
 ing forward to investigatein this session.

DTEND:20160426T194000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Born out of ETSI NFV IFA004 and OPNFV DPACC requirements\, the
  Nomad project aims to fulfill them and provide a distributed acceleration
  management as a service framework for OpenStack.With Openstack\, currentl
 y people could already utilize acceleration techniques like SR-IOV\, PCI p
 ass-through and DPDK via Nova and Neutron. In NFV environments\, on the ot
 her hand\, OpenStack should also be able to manage heterogeneous accelerat
 ors (i.e.\, re-configurable FPGAs\, GPUs\, etc) life cycle andschedule the
 m to fulfill VNF requirements such as transparent live migration.However\,
  Nomad VMs' acceleration is not related only to NFV. As a matter of fact\,
  accelerators are extensively used also in other environments\, e.g.\, sto
 rage and big data\, with many new solutions such as SPDK\, NVMe and pmem.T
 he Nomad project will serve as a standalone module to provide VMs accelera
 tor scheduling and life cycle management\, aiming to make OpenStack accele
 rated workloads truly nomadic for NFV\, storage\, big data\, etc.

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Ironic\, the OpenStack Bare Metal Provisioning Program is evol
 ving fast with many new functionalities integrating with it. Thus\, the ne
 ed to perform scale testing on these functionalities with a large no. of B
 are Metals (BMs) ends up being a costly affair. To circumvent the redundan
 cy\, we came up with an approach to simulate virtual bare metals through t
 he libvirt management API.Currently\, Ironic provisions BMs only on flat n
 etworks. We showcase the simulation technique by scale testing our service
  that extends the plumbing of BM server ports into VLANs.This talk also ai
 ms at providing a simple model network architecture over which the simulat
 ed bare metal works seamlessly with the existing hypervisors/compute nodes

DESCRIPTION:From the moment OpenStack control plane is deployed it becomes
  a working piece of history. Why not treat OpenStack services like set of 
 living projects that uses the same tools the developers use to build\, tes
 t and deploy your OpenStack? Openstack-salt provides model that allows to 
 deploy security patches\, bug fixes\, manage service lifecycle and release
 s off a simple git commit. This makes your OpenStack operationally managea
 ble once again and adding new hypervisors or entire regions is fun again. 
 Continuous Delivery with Openstack-salt doesn't mean that every change is 
 deployed to production right away\, but means that every changes is proven
  and can be deployed safely at any time.What is the problem or use case yo
 u’re addressing in this session?How do you stay current with OpenStack? 
 How to control operations of your OpenStack deployment.
