SUMMARY:Key Requirements for OpenStack Backup and Recovery

DESCRIPTION:With increasingly complex and critical IT environments\, compa
 nies are looking for ways to fully protect their business\, while at the s
 ame time providing easier\, faster and more reliable recovery. One of the 
 biggest challenges when deploying an OpenStack cloud in an organization is
  the ability to provide a policy-based\, automated\, comprehensive backup 
 and recovery solution.This session\, co-presented by Murali Balcha\, one o
 f the creators of Raksha and co-founder and CTO of Trilio Data\, and Brian
  Davis\, CTO at OnX Enterprise Solutions and former Director / Portfolio A
 rchitect Cloud Engineering at American Express\, will discuss the maturing
  pets vs cattle approach and compare and contrast current approaches to Op
 enStack backup with what an ideal backup solution looks like. Attendees wi
 ll come away with a solid understanding of how to cobble together APIs for
  backup\, and why a more holistic approach will better meet the needs of b
 usiness-critical OpenStack environments.

DESCRIPTION:With the continuing\, widespread\, rapid adoption of OpenStack
  cloud platform and its ever-expanding integration with third party produc
 ts\, there is a need for comprehensive\, end-to-end cloud monitoring solut
 ions. We present here a Zenoss monitoring solution that monitors OpenStack
  Cloud\, including various module components\, services\, performance metr
 ics and events\, as well as several third party products used by the OpenS
 tack Cloud.We first briefly describe the steps involved in Zenoss System f
 or monitoring OpenStack Cloud. We next demonstrate the Nova monitoring wit
 h KVM hypervisor\; Neutron monitoring with OpenvSwitch\, Cisco APIC\; Cind
 er monitoring with LVM and Ceph. We will also show the interrelationships 
 and impacts among connected components.

DESCRIPTION:Bringing a third partner to a two partner OpenStack solution i
 s always a challenge.  When Dell realized a need to extend the Dell Red H
 at OpenStack Cloud Solution to bring in a “highly available overlay netw
 ork provider"\, they turned to Midokura Enterprise MidoNet. How did Dell a
 nd Red Hat then bring Midokura to the table\, encouraging all the differen
 t teams to work towards one single goal\, to produce a “joint multi-part
 ner solution" and deliver the solution in a timely fashion?Cross-functiona
 l teams are the new norm when building OpenStack solutions\, be it Enterpr
 ise IT deployment strategists or best-of-breed solution providers. We will
  hear the perspectives seen from each team on how they responded to this t
 ask and what they saw as challenges.This will be an interactive session an
 d we will ask those in the audience to relate their experiences. Bring you
 r tiger team stories and let's learn how everyone can build better solutio
 ns to leverage the unique skill sets of each contributor!

DESCRIPTION:This session will explore VMTurbo's patented framework for Ope
 nStack performance assurance\, as well as how this framework permits organ
 izations to safely run ultra-high density OpenStack nodes in order to reap
  the greatest CapEx savings possible.Participants will learn about the str
 ucture of VMTurbo's market abstraction algorithm\, which enables OpenStack
  QoS adherence\, and how Nova\, Cinder\, Neutron\, Ceilometer\, and Keysto
 ne metrics have been utilized to bring these functions to life.Enterprises
  choose OpenStack to eliminate OpEx costs\, accelerate application develop
 ment lifecycles\, and command their business destinies. For those that hav
 e successfully migrated off a legacy virtualized infrastruture or propriet
 ary IaaS\, the initial benefits of OpenStack can be slowly eroded without 
 solid performance and efficiency strategies.Use cases well cover include:A
 utomated OpenStack Service AssuranceDifferentiating service levels with Op
 enStack tiered service offeringsand many more

DESCRIPTION:This is the story of marketers from diverse organizations\, sh
 aring their advice and lessons on how to bet big on OpenStack marketing an
 d win.Once upon a time\, it was easy to market a major tech force like clo
 ud. Everybody was inexcept for OpenStack. It was too unlikely to even be c
 onsidered the underdog. Now who's on top of the share-of-voice stack?You p
 robably know some OpenStack evangelists who are killing it. But their succ
 ess wasnt linear. They were audaciously pushing rocks uphill for years\, a
 nd today if you mention OpenStack\, anyone in tech will lend an ear. The q
 uestion now: how do you capitalize on it?This panel will open source prove
 n strategies that show you how to win the multifaceted marketing game\, in
 cluding weaving OpenStack into your companys story and content marketing s

 irs automated deployment pipelines create host aggregates in Openstack\, c
 reate layer 3 subnets in Nuage mapped to Openstack\, provision instances i
 nto these subnets\, deploy software and then roll the instances into servi
 ce on a load balancer in a zero downtime fashion in just 7 minutes.

DESCRIPTION:The power of the community is what makes open source initiativ
 es extremely transformationallike OpenStack. On the other hand\, enterpris
 e users who are looking at adopting this solution need to go through a ste
 ep learning curve and deep transformation of their internal team structure
 . The power of OpenStack is actually greatly amplified by the ecosystem of
  vendors around it that look at important aspects like support and hardeni
 ng as well as augmentation of specific aspects (e.g. scalability and perfo
 rmance) that are needed in production environments bringing the most value
  to users. Join Rackspace and PLUMgrid product specialists to learn how we
  jointly enable our Private Cloud enterprise users to consume OpenStack an
 d Software Defined Networks (SDN) as ONE solution that brings comprehensiv
 e security\, scalability and performance and a rich set of operational too
