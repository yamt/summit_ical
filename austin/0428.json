As each core node hosts few hundred thousand subscriber sessions, a sub-second level fast recovery is necessary not only to ensure seamless connectivity to the customers, but also to avoid the consequent &lsquo;attach&rsquo; storm where all disconnected mobile devices try to reconnect to the mobile network simultaneously, creating control traffic beyond what a node can handle. In NFV-based networks, recovery actions will be performed by a node manager which cannot directly detect virtualized network infrastructure level failures. Therefore, OpenStack needs to detect and notify the corresponding node manager of relevant resource failure.

Or you may just want to better understand how ML2 works and what it can do.<\/p>\r\n<p>The focus of this session, ML2's \"port binding\", is the process by which the ML2 plugin selects the&nbsp;mechanism driver(s) and network segment(s) to&nbsp;be utilized for a specific Neutron port. Port binding must succeed before a port will provide the requested connectivity. Its outcome configures the datapath and determines the details needed by Nova or other services to connect to the desired Neutron network. Port binding enables ML2 to support heterogeneous environments.
