The educational program requires students to work on real-life bug fixes or new features during two days of real-life classes and online mentoring, until the work is accepted by OpenStack. The live two-day class teaches them to navigate the intricacies of the project&rsquo;s technical tools and social interactions. In a followup session, the students benefit from individual online sessions to help them resolve any remaining problems they might have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px; color: #666a73; font-family: 'Benton Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"padding-top: 0px;\">Make sure to book your travel plans to arrive in Austin Friday evening or Saturday morning in order to attend the full two-day training session.<\/span><\/p>","start_datetime":"2016-04-24 10:00:00","end_datetime":"2016-04-24 16:00:00","start_time":"10:00am","end_time":"4:00pm","date_nice":"Sun 24","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":42,"type_id":1,"rsvp_link":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/upstream-university-openstack-summit-austin-tickets-22669105906","sponsors_id":[],"summit_types_id":[1],"category_group_ids":[1],"tags_id":[],"own":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"attendees_schedule_count":44,"speakers_id":[63],"moderator_id":0,"track_id":41,"level":"Beginner","status":"unaccepted"},{"id":6829,"title":"Command Presence Workshop, Organized by the Women of OpenStack","description":null,"class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/commandpresenceworkshop.eventbrite.com\">RSVP Required<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Command Presence\u00a0Workshop<\/strong> has been recognized by the Anita Borg Institute and Harvard Business Review.\u00a0 It is intended to teach participants how to handle \u201csenior-level high pressure meetings\u201d.\u00a0 The majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address a simulated, but very realistic crisis event.\u00a0 In the class, each participant assumes a role, and is given about 30minutes to prepare 1-2 slides.\u00a0 Once the class has prepared, the simulation begins.\u00a0 There is a role-play simulation.
