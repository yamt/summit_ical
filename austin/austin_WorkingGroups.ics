SUMMARY:Command Presence Workshop\, Organized by the Women of OpenStack
DTSTART:20160424T170000Z
DTEND:20160424T200000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:RSVP Required.The Command Presence Workshop has been recogniz
 ed by the Anita Borg Institute and Harvard Business Review.  It is intend
 ed to teach participants how to handle “senior-level high pressure meeti
 ngs”.  The majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address
  a simulated\, but very realistic crisis event.  In the class\, each part
 icipant assumes a role\, and is given about 30minutes to prepare 1-2 slide
 s.  Once the class has prepared\, the simulation begins.  There is a rol
 e-play simulation. It is not uncommon to hear occasional “gasps” of di
 sbelief from the participants.  The workshop participants will experience
  rapid-fire questioning\, interruption\, and other situations that occur i
 n senior-level meetings\, but in a safe environment conducive to learning 
 techniques for handling such situations. Facilitators: Ruchi Bhargava (In
 tel)\, Malini Bhandaru (Intel) and a panel of leaders representative of 
 the OpenStack leadership in the community (business leaders and technical
  leaders).

  the Mitaka cycle including guidelines that have merged\, cross projectint
 eractions and a retrospective on what has worked well and wherethings coul
 d be improved. We'll follow this with discussion offuture plans\, especial

 in the group. Any remaining time willbe devoted to open discussion and mee
 ting other people interested inimproving OpenStack's APIs.

SUMMARY:And Now For Our Regularly Scheduled OpenStack Roadmap Update!
DTSTART:20160426T204000Z
DTEND:20160426T212000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:OpenStack continues to grow the number of projects in the Big 
 Tent\, and each Project is developing at a rapid pace. Whether you're an O
 penStack Operator\, Vendor\, Contributor or Market Watcher\, how do you ke
 ep up with this? That's where we come in! The OpenStack Product Work Group
  strives to work across our community to create a condensed\, simplified s
 et of roadmaps of the capabilities you can expect in the upcoming project 
 releases.In this session we'll present our findings across the different p
 rojects in an effort to give users a glimpse into OpenStack's upcoming cap
 abilities. The roadmaps presented will span multiple releases and strive t
 o unify the future direction of the individual projects on a per release b
 asis. The findings are collected through direct interviews with the PTLs a
 nd condensed into an easy to consume format. You could try and track down 
 what's coming through dozens of etherpads\, hundreds of blueprints and spe
 nd your days living in IRC. Or you could come to our session. Consider it 
 your ticket to seeing a glimpse into OpenStack's future.The proliferation 
 of Projects within the OpenStack community combined with ever increasing c
 apabilities focused on addressing the needs of Markets and Operators is a 
 good thing. But for someone looking to deploy an OpenStack Cloud\, or defi
 ne their update plan or even understand where they best can contribute\, t
 his can be a challenge. We are working to address this need through the cr
 eation and discussion of cross-community condensed\, simplified roadmaps t
 hat outline what you can expect in the upcoming project releases (yes\, th
 is is multi-release!).

SUMMARY:Scientific Community Clouds: Five Directors of Community Clouds Re

DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:A must see panel for CEOs & CIOs: The largest community-driven
  clouds on the planet? Scientific cloud computing for collaborative resear
 ch: governments in the EU (Horizon2020)\, USA (NSF)\, Taiwan (UniCloud Tai
 wan)\, France (Iana-GRID.5000) and Australia (NCRIS-NeCTAR) have made sign
 ificant multi-million dollar investments in the creation of community driv
 en scientific clouds. The infrastructure being used to operate these cloud
 s is OpenStack. The purpose of this panel is to bring together key stakeho
 lders and computation center decision makers from the research community t
 o: a.) surface unmet needs\, b.) identify current and near-term solution\,
  and c.) explore the scope for how science communities can identify gaps f
 or future cloud development.If you have a question for the panel please po

SUMMARY:Massively Distributed Clouds Working Group Inaugural Meeting
DTSTART:20160426T214000Z
DTEND:20160426T231000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:The objectives of this inaugural meeting are: - To present in
  details the massively distributed cloud use-case (aka\, the Fog/Edge Comp
 uting paradigm) - To identify persons/institutions that might be interest
 ed to take part to such a WG\; - To identify on-going related activities 
 addressed inside but also outside the OpenStack community (short presentat
 ions will be given)\; - To define a roadmap and identify key persons that
  can contribute to make OpenStack cooperative by default.The major differe
 nce with respect to existing WGs such as the Large-Scale deployment one\, 
 is that we would like to address challenges related to the geo-distributio
 n of resources and WANwide exchanges (one single cloud/cell but deployed a
 cross multiple small sites). Concretely\, we want to study how the vanilla
  OpenStack code can support the Fog/Edge Computing use-case while minimisi
 ng the changes on the OpenStack internals.Further information available at

 the broadest set of viewpoints and experience will enable us to create the
  most innovative and impactful technologies in support of the OpenStack Mi
 ssion.A broad set of community members formed the Diversity Work Group tha
 t has worked over the last yearto form a framework for a diverse community
  through the creation of a Diversity Policy\, integrated Diversity expecta
 tions into our Code of Conducts and identified initial areas of focus for 
 extending the diversity of our community. Please come join us to discuss t
 he teams work and shape the future direction.Additional speakers: Carol Ba

SUMMARY:Git and Gerrit Lunch and Learn\, Organized by The Women of OpenSta
 ck

DTEND:20160427T185000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:RSVP Required.OpenStack software development is centered aroun
 d the git and gerrit systems to promote the aspect of community programmin
 g.Git is an open source version control system that allows many software d
 evelopers to work on a given project without requiring them to share a com
 mon network.Gerrit is a free\, web-based team code collaboration tool whic
 h integrates closely with git and allows developers in a team to review ea
 ch other's modifications to the source code using a web browser and approv
 e or reject those changes.In this session we will walk-through participant
 s to open a bug in a test system and then submit a test patch to a reposit
 ory in OpenStack. The process involves learning about git along with a che
 at sheet of most useful commands and review process in Gerrit. Participant
 s will walk away with working knowledge on these tools.

 nthly in IRC to discuss the issues and needs of large OpenStack deployment
 s.As of late\, we have also started looking after the needs of Public Clou
 ds running OpenStack because many of their issue overlap with those of the
  LDT. Also\, these deployments tend to scale fairly quickly.

 ranslation check and etc. We have tools to support these processes\, e.g.
  use Zanata and automation jobs.In this session\, we want to collect feed
 back from translators and evaluate the inconveniences of current translati
 on tools and translation processes. We will have translators and tool deve
 lopers together and discuss about how to improve in the future.The worksho
