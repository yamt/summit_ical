We will show the necessary\u00a0plumbing for the integration, and discuss potential issues in providing\u00a0networking and storage through Mesos.<\/p>","start_datetime":"2016-04-27 09:00:19","end_datetime":"2016-04-27 09:40:59","start_time":"9:00am","end_time":"9:40am","date_nice":"Wed 27","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":54,"type_id":1,"rsvp_link":"","sponsors_id":[],"summit_types_id":[1],"category_group_ids":[3],"tags_id":[3370,12,3374,3373,3368,2662],"own":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"attendees_schedule_count":175,"speakers_id":[1067,848,4438],"moderator_id":0,"track_id":31,"level":"Intermediate","status":"alternate"},{"id":7441,"title":"Neutron DSCP: Policing your Network","description":null,"class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p><span style=\"color: #555555; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;\">DSCP is used by large enterprises to manage network traffic intelligently.

AND it accepts and translates NFS files.<\/p>","start_datetime":"2016-04-27 11:00:00","end_datetime":"2016-04-27 11:40:00","start_time":"11:00am","end_time":"11:40am","date_nice":"Wed 27","allow_feedback":"0","location_id":64,"type_id":1,"rsvp_link":"","sponsors_id":[260],"summit_types_id":[1],"category_group_ids":[],"tags_id":[],"own":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"attendees_schedule_count":38},{"id":9387,"title":"Freezer: Work session","description":"Freezer Backup as a Service\n<br \/><br \/>Let's discuss how Freezer can provide better \"Backup as a Service\" to users of the cloud.\n<br \/><br \/>We will focus on what needs to be added or improved in Freezer to seamlessly provide this.\n<br \/>We will also think about scalability and how to deal with the big\/numerous backup generated by this problematic.\n<br \/><br \/>Etherpad: https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/freezer_austin_session_baas","class_name":"SummitEvent","abstract":"Freezer Backup as a Service\n<br \/><br \/>Let's discuss how Freezer can provide better \"Backup as a Service\" to users of the cloud.\n<br \/><br \/>We will focus on what needs to be added or improved in Freezer to seamlessly provide this.\n<br \/>We will also think about scalability and how to deal with the big\/numerous backup generated by this problematic.\n<br \/><br \/>Etherpad: https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/freezer_austin_session_baas","start_datetime":"2016-04-27 11:00:00","end_datetime":"2016-04-27 11:40:00","start_time":"11:00am","end_time":"11:40am","date_nice":"Wed 27","allow_feedback":"0","location_id":90,"type_id":9,"rsvp_link":"","sponsors_id":[],"summit_types_id":[2],"category_group_ids":[],"tags_id":[3541],"own":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"attendees_schedule_count":13},{"id":9243,"title":"Fuel: Work session","description":"Title: Fuel UI Modularization approaches discussion\n<br \/>Session lead:  V.

What is the most seamless way to connect to an OpenStack-based cloud with the least disruption? In both cases, it makes sense to utilize a software-defined storage controller that is able to direct storage traffic between storage infrastructure and orchestration platforms, including OpenStack.

In order to connect this new wave of microservices with non-microservices - including everything from setup and provisioning of networking and other complex services on any cloud, hybrid environment support coupled with orchestration through a single pane of glass is simply imperative for such a complex operation. By fusing the TOSCA standard with best of breed open source tooling and infrastructure, Cloudify, coupled with Riemann, can holistically orchestrate, auto-scale, and instrument arbitrarily diverse architectures, including but not limited to Kubernetes clusters, Kubernetes microservices, and non-containerized services on physical and virtual infrastructure including networking (e.g. Openstack Neutron).<\/p>\n<p>By modeling K8S into TOSCA it is now possible to easily orchestrate microservices alongside non-microservices in the same template. This enables you to gather metrics for container images, and trigger event-driven workflows for auto-scaling and healing with Riemann - both inside and out of K8S, and all the way through the entire hybrid deployment - extending to your (more) conventional cloud hosted services such as OpenStack, AWS, and Azure.<\/p>","start_datetime":"2016-04-27 14:20:00","end_datetime":"2016-04-27 14:40:00","start_time":"2:20pm","end_time":"2:40pm","date_nice":"Wed 27","allow_feedback":"0","location_id":79,"type_id":1,"rsvp_link":"","sponsors_id":[43],"summit_types_id":[1],"category_group_ids":[],"tags_id":[1419,705,3419,3370,3599,1415],"own":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"attendees_schedule_count":35},{"id":7658,"title":"Automating the Deployment of a Secure, Multi-User HIPAA Enabled Spark Cluster Using Sahara","description":null,"class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p>Interest in using analytics platforms such as Hadoop and Spark to process highly sensitive personal data (e.g., health care data, financial records) is on the rise.

In this talk, we share our experiences using Sahara to automate the provisioning of a HIPAA-enabled Spark-as-a-Service platform. We detail the enhancements to Sahara needed to: (i) automate cluster security enablement (e.g., authentication, key management, encryption); (ii) support multi-user clusters to provide strong isolation; (iii) enable cluster deployment on SoftLayer through Heat; and (iv) submit multi-type jobs (e.g,.

The evaluation results show that our design can deliver near bare-metal performance. The MVAPICH2 over OpenStack software package presented in this talk is publicly available from http:\/\/mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu.<\/p>","start_datetime":"2016-04-27 15:30:19","end_datetime":"2016-04-27 16:10:59","start_time":"3:30pm","end_time":"4:10pm","date_nice":"Wed 27","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":60,"type_id":1,"rsvp_link":"","sponsors_id":[],"summit_types_id":[1],"category_group_ids":[8],"tags_id":[3419,3373,34],"own":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"attendees_schedule_count":27,"speakers_id":[4175,4174],"moderator_id":0,"track_id":28,"level":"Intermediate","status":"accepted"},{"id":8845,"title":"Dive into The Migration of Stateful Application to DCOS Platform - the Practice in China Mobile","description":null,"class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p>In the data center OS model,DCOS behaves like the Operating System,managing hardware resources and providing that information to application frameworks to schedule tasks across dozens or thousands of machines.

He will report on the experience of setting up virtual clusters with batch schedulers on OpenStack to provide an HPC environment for life sciences users. These users build complex pipelines comprised of many tools, operating on multi-terabyte datasets, historically on centrally-provided bare-metal clusters. Adam will describe how the problems of reliably constructing such clusters were overcome with OpenStack, and the challenges in achieving high performance on OpenStack with clusters of this size.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Calleja and Wojciech Turek will describe how Cambridge University is building an HPC bioinformatics platform upon OpenStack infrastructure. The performance of this software stack depends on an IO subsystem optimised for data access patterns characteristic to HPC and current bioinformatics workloads in genomics. Current high-throughput technologies such as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) produce unprecedented scales of data in genomics and clinical projects, with many projects producing petabytes of data. Most existing bioinformatics solutions have problems scaling and dealing efficiently with current data volumes, making it hard to store, analyze, share and visualize the data. Cambridge&rsquo;s approach focuses on solutions that deliver low-latency and high-throughput access to storage.<\/p>","start_datetime":"2016-04-27 16:30:19","end_datetime":"2016-04-27 17:10:59","start_time":"4:30pm","end_time":"5:10pm","date_nice":"Wed 27","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":62,"type_id":1,"rsvp_link":"","sponsors_id":[],"summit_types_id":[1],"category_group_ids":[8],"tags_id":[1419,1527,3374,2033,3373,493,35,34],"own":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"attendees_schedule_count":55,"speakers_id":[2905,5176],"moderator_id":0,"track_id":28,"level":"Intermediate","status":"accepted"},{"id":8609,"title":"Private Swift Endpoint","description":null,"class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p>In some cases, administrators have to restrict outbound reachability of internal tenant network.<\/p>\r\n<p>Swift endpoints are no exception.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this talk, we will discuss how we can make workaround to provideaccess to Swift for closed tenant network.

In this session, we will provide an introduction to the Manila file share service, a description of the logical architecture of Manila and its API structure, examples of use cases, an exploration of whats coming in Mitaka from share replication, LVM, cephfs, data copy service, and a brief demo.<\/p>","start_datetime":"2016-04-27 17:20:01","end_datetime":"2016-04-27 18:00:41","start_time":"5:20pm","end_time":"6:00pm","date_nice":"Wed 27","allow_feedback":"1","location_id":59,"type_id":1,"rsvp_link":"","sponsors_id":[],"summit_types_id":[1],"category_group_ids":[8],"tags_id":[3370,1527,12,3373,3382],"own":false,"favorite":false,"show":true,"headcount":0,"attendees_schedule_count":78,"speakers_id":[4584,4973],"moderator_id":0,"track_id":25,"level":"Intermediate","status":"accepted"},{"id":9538,"title":"Bright Computing - High Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data on demand with Cluster-as-a-Service (CaaS)","description":null,"class_name":"Presentation","abstract":"<p><span>Cluster-as-a-Service (CaaS) is an innovative concept that empowers end users of an OpenStack private cloud to easily create sophisticated, isolated, and secure clustered infrastructure within their private cloud.
