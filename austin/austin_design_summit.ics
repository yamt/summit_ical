 nt is rapidly approaching a critical point in the project. In the Mitaka r
 elease there was a xproject spec to deprecate all individual CLIs [1]. A f
 ew things are falling into place to make Newton a critical development cyc
 le for the OSC team and other projects. i) In the Newton release the keyst
 one team will no longer ship a CLI in keystoneclient [2]\, making OSC a co
 mmon tool for operators\; ii) Missing capabilities for networking and v2 v
 olume support is quickly being added\; iii) Several new projects have crea
 ted or are creating OSC plugins [3]\, and the main issue of commands overl
 apping each other should be caught early by a gate job.With that said\, it
 's not all perfect. The cinder team has brought up some issues [4]\, namel
 y the properties vs metadata naming convention. This issue\, and other con
 ventions the OSC has adopted that divert from the typical CLI usage should
  be addressed now rather than when it is too late. Additionally\, the topi
 c of "when" a team should switch / advertise / deprecate has been brought 
 up many times\, and likely needs consensus and a standardized plan.With al

DESCRIPTION:Session Leader(s): Thomas HerveIn Heat we've been introducing 
 a way to use Zaqar to store events/status updates about stacks. It allows 
 moving away from API-polling on Heat\, using the WebSocket transport in Za
 qar. Using WebSocket also means that integration in web UIs like Horizon i
 s really seamless. I'd like to talk about that approach\, whether or not i
 t can be used in other components\, and if it's practical for cross-compon
 ent communications.The main idea for Nova would be to provide a way to say
 : "Please store the status updates of this server in this Zaqar queue". Af
 terwards\, the various state changes generate messages that the user can r
 etrieve to know where its server is at (in particular ACTIVE\, but error s
 tates are interesting in the long run as well). We need 1) A nice interfac
 e to provide the queue 2) The internal machinery to send the messages (whi
 ch map relatively well to some notifications AFAIU). Heat has environment 
 files where you can easily put that information\, for example.References:

DESCRIPTION:Session Leader(s): Doug HellmannWe maintain a list of global r
 equirements for two main reasons: Ensuring co-installability and minimizin
 g the technology divergence between projects as part of our consistency ef
 fort. While consistency is a good goal\, managing the list of *versions* o
 f dependencies is a huge amount of work\, especially around release time w
 hen we need to make sure all projects are synced up. There is also risk as
  we move ahead with the constraints system\, because we don't have suffici
 ent test coverage of constraints changes to know when those changes will b
 reak a project. As part of my push to remove self-imposed requirements tha
 t introduce more work than gain\, I propose that we drop our requirement f
 or co-installability of all services and let each project manage its own v
 ersions of dependendencies and constraints directly by relying on containe
 rs for deployment and/or container-ish things like virtualenvs for our CI 
 testing. However\, I propose that we keep a list of packages allowed to be
  used\, without specifying the versions\, to maintain our consistency goal
 . Is this possible? What do we lose? What do we gain?References: - https:/

                        There are some shortcomings of the current oslo.pol
 icy approach that I think we can overcome with a little bit of work.  * De
 ployers can't easily determine where they've overriden defaults\, because 
 defaults aren't defined separately from policy.json. * It's not possible t
 o determine an exhaustive list of which policies will pass for a request c
 ontext. This prevents exposing information to users on what actions they a
 re allowed to perform.By modeling policy more like configuration we can em
 bed defaults in the code and deployers need only configure policies that d
 iffer from these defaults. And policy rules could be linked to 'capabiliti
 es' so that services can inform users of what they're allowed to do. Refer

DESCRIPTION:Session Leader(s): Brant KnudsonKeystone is dropping eventlet 
 support\, so it's not run with keystone-all anymore. Instead it's run in a
  wsgi container. There's lots of options for wsgi containers: mod_wsgi in 
 apache\, uwsgi\, gunicorn. If you run with uwsgi or gunicorn it's typicall
 y fronted with apache or nginx. On top of this\, an advantage to apache/ng
 inx is that you can easily forward requests on different paths to differen
 t servers\, so rather than using ports for each service we can have apache
  accept on port 80 (e.g.\, /identity -> keystone-public\, /identity_admin 
 -> keystone-admin\, /dashboard -> horizon\, /compute -> nova-api\, etc.).D
 evstack also has a tls-proxy config option which is there to put stud in f
 ront of the eventlet servers (because of eventlet server's weak TLS suppor
 t). There's no need for this if we're using apache or nginx since it's got
  strong TLS support.The cross-project request is if we can get other serve
 rs supporting wsgi (use the pbr entrypoint?) and using the same deployment
 .Also\, we need to figure out how to get tempest working with this because
  now it's not. tempest verify-config doesn't get /identity (or /compute) a
 s the unversioned endpoint when the versioned endpoint is /identity/v2.0 (
 it uses / instead). So\, does tempest want to support this configuration\,
  and how?References: - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/193894/ - devstack

DESCRIPTION:Session Leader(s): Mike Perez\, Monty Taylor\, Rocky GOne of t
 he recurring themes on the ML in this development cycle has been discovery
 .  Discovery of capabilities\; discovery of configurations and defaults\, 
 discover of all sorts of things.  So\, wouldn't it be great if the communi
 ty could actually be proactive and plan how discovery should be formatted/
 called/interfaced to across all the projects before all the projects imple
 ment their discovery(s) differently?  And hey\, maybe this raises the ques
 tion of whether an Oslo lib can help with consistency\, too.  I'd like to 
 see the community get a converged set of requirements and design *before* 
 each writes its divergent version.  It's not top of the list priority for 
 development for this cycle\, which is good.  A session now can get folks t
 hinking about how to do this consistently and get specs in place this cycl
 e\, without having to prioritize code for this for Newton.References: - no

 mechanism that is based around python function calls rather than command l
 ines. Nova/Cinder use libraries like os-brick/os-vif need to run commands 
 that need privileges. The issue with oslo.rootwrap is that there isn't an 
 elegant way for libraries like os-brick to "own" their own rootwrap conf f
 iles. oslo.privsep is a better way to handle such situations. We need to f
 igure out how to transition from oslo.rootwrap to oslo.privsep with an eye
  towards backwards compat\, customized rootwrap configurations etc. It'd a
 lso be nice to talk about blockers that integrated projects have\, or any 
 knowledge they need to make this process easier (and/or figure out what is
  lacking or missing from projects timelines to make such a transition poss
 ible).References:  -  https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/oslo-specs/spe

 nts a problem as to who should conduct the threat analysis.  The security 
 team will clearly be overwhelmed if they attempted to conduct TA for the 5
 0 or so projects in OpenStack.  This session is about discussion of option
 s for scaling the TA.The Security team is developing a lightweight TA proc
 ess with the intention to have each project do their own TA\, and hand off
  to the security team for official validation\, after which the security P
 TL could apply a TA tag to the deliverable analyzed.  Longer term\, the VM
 T could depend on the TA tag.  There may be other options. This session is
  about sorting out the best way to scale the VMT without blowing up the se

 into more open feedback / priorities-gathering sessions getting the commun

 located project team members gatherings in a separate event where teams ca
 n plan and start executing the work for the upcoming cycle. There are stil

  "number of physical NICs must match the number of Neutron ports connected
  to the instance" problem. A couple of example use cases:    1) baremetal 
 machine has two NICs connected in a bond\, and more than 2 networks need t
 o be trunked down to the bond (let's say\, two provider networks (one publ
 ic\, one internal-DC for services)\, and one or more tenant networks).    
 2) operator deploys a fleet of baremetal machines to run hypervisors\, and
  wishes to express which networks go over which physical links (management
  net goes over one bond\, tunnel network for tenant networks goes over ano
 ther)In general\, from the Nova user's perspective\, we aim to decouple th
 e physical networking infrastructure from the Neutron networks that ride o
 n top of it.We'd like to meet with the Nova and Neutron teams and map out 
 how this works in code\, and tease out any major problems we'll come acros

DESCRIPTION: General description Glance image sharing has some weirdnesses
  (for example\, the 'visibility=shared' image-list filter that filters on 
 a non-existent visibility value) and some limitations (sharing is one-many
 \, but you must identify each of the many individually).  The community ha
 s discussed implementing "community" images several times in the past\, an
 d there are some detailed design documents.  The aim of this session is to
  verify that the existing design meets current use cases and to get ground
 swell of support going to finally get this done in Newton.  The groundswel
 l has started\, there's already a new spec up. Drivers Brian Rosmaita Nikh
 il Komawar  More about this session  What problem is this trying to solve?
  We propose to extend the current Images v2 image sharing functionality (w
 hich includes an anti-spam provision) to include one-to-all sharing ("comm
 unity" images) while at the same time cleaning up the semantics and some i
 mplementation details of the current scheme.  What's currently out there? 
  Glance has implemented image sharing as defined in the OpenStack Images v
 2 API  What are best practices\, feedback and experiences from cross-prj o
 r other teams?  Don't think any other OpenStack resources are "shareable" 
 in this way.  Feedback has been that for the common use case of an open so
 urce project making an image available to anyone who wants to use it\, the
  current image-sharing scheme is inadequate.  What is the scope of the cur
 rent proposal?  Scope of this session: In addition to discussing the curre
 nt spec and design for Community images\, we'd like to discuss sharing in 
 Glare (the Glance Artifacts Repositiory). Scope of the proposal: Neaten th
 e Glance 'visibility' semantics and add "community" visibility.What has be
 en discussed\, what are/were the blockers and any other reference informat
 ion? This topic has been discussed at previous summits and midcycle meetin
 gs.  The consensus was that we really need to clean up the 'visibility' se
 mantics before adding "community" images\, which makes this a bigger proje
 ct than simply adding one-all image sharing.  References  V2 Community Ima

 Senlin\, if cloud operator wants  to add auto-scaling function or somethin
 g can easily done by Senlin\,Should Senlin support a way to make those nov
 a servers under control of Senlin? This can be done by 'senlin node-create
 -exist --exist-node xxx node_name' by adding an option '--exist-node'.  Th
 e new node can be added to a cluster and controlled by the policies attach
 ed to the cluster. This function may be needed when deploying container cl
 uster in a cloud.    use case: user may want to use Senlin to start contai
 ners in the vms which are created by Magnum( using auto-scaling function)2
 ) semi-autoscalingComplex solutions may require outside intervention/suppo
 rt for making scaling decisions.  For example management approval before s
 caling beyond certain limits.The proposal here is to support notifications
  of scaling events and allow\, properly authenticated\, external services 
 to trigger scaling actions.

 derator: Travis Truman (automagically)Description:A work session to improv

 cal vars that are a hangover from the time before we had config_template. 
 Let's figure out which we can remove and do so. Now that we have a depreca
 tion filter we can make use of that to notify deployers and take them thro
 ugh a deprecation cycle if we feel that's important. The aim is to simplif
 y the roles and reduce technical debt. There is an overwhelming number of 
 task tags assigned between all of the roles involved in OpenStack-Ansible.
  And in some cases\, limiting to one particular tag may not have any subst
 antial outcome. Look into consistency of tagging between roles and trimmin
 g down of existing tags. The intended outcome of this session is to identi
 fy and remove unnecessary deps\, tags and vars\; to design for removing in
 ventory deps\; and to establish a design pattern for role variable namespa

DESCRIPTION:Some deployers of OpenStack and users of large OpenStack cloud
 s want to have their cake and eat it - they want encryption services in th
 e cloud with keys that aren't exposed to the cloud. This is pretty much im
 possible but what can be achieved is minimising the exposure of key materi
 al within cloud operations. Generally speaking BYOK falls into two categor
 ies - "push" and "pull". In a "push" model\, (similar to AWS/Azure) the us
 er may include key material with an API call to perform some function (lik
 e fetch object) and the services will use the provided key to decrypt/encr
 ypt as appropriate. In a "pull" model the OpenStack key manager has a fede
 rated relationship with a remote HSM - they communicate and share keys as 
 appropriate.This session\, along with the Barbican one on BYOK the next da
 y\, should be used to discuss the future of both the "push" and "pull" met
 hods - a good place to start might be capturing concrete use cases.

DESCRIPTION:Data in docker container can be stored in two places: the thin

  the container is deleted. Data stored in data volumes are persisted in th
 e host.Magnum already supports using Cinder volumes for storing image laye
 rs. In this session\, we are going to discuss how to add support for data 
 volumes. In particular\, we will explore the possibility of mounting Cinde

DESCRIPTION:Manila needs a grouping construct that\, like shares\, is a 1s
 t-class atomic data type. Our experience with CGs has demonstrated the com
 plexity of adding a grouping capability\, yet there are other use cases su
 ch as migration\, replication\, and backup in which some storage controlle
 rs could only offer such features on share groups. CGs also highlighted th
 e poor optics of an advanced feature with comparatively little potential f
 or vendor support. And adding new grouping constructs for each new feature
  is not technically feasible. All of the above may be addressed by generic
  groups\, which we think is a clean extension to the original architecture
  of Manila.Led by: Clinton Knight

SUMMARY:SearchLight: API Callbacks are Bad - Improve the Notifications (No

DTSTART:20160428T183000Z
DTEND:20160428T191000Z
DTSTAMP:20160424T225025Z
DESCRIPTION:Searchlight dramatically improves the user focused search capa
 bilities and performance on behalf of various OpenStack cloud services. It
  accomplishes this by offloading user search queries from existing API ser
 vers and indexing their data into ElasticSearch.Initial indexing is done o
 n demand\, but keeping the index up-to-date is dependent on notifications 
 from the various services. Right now there are gaps in data and events fro
 m the various services.In a number of places we're forced to hit service A
 PIs in notification handlers because notifications don't contain all the i
 nformation we'd like to index. We've justified this by asserting that the 
 information we get from APIs is necessary to index\, but this has backed u
 s into a corner in some places (notably Nova). We need to decide whether t
 his continues to be OK\, or whether we put more emphasis on improving noti
 fications and/or accepting some data cannot be indexed.We'd ideally like t
 o get contributors from other service teams (Nova\, Neutron\, Cinder\, Gla
 nce\, Ironic\, Magnum\, others) into this room to help understand the Sear
 chlight needs and help us to understand the impact of improving notificati
 on vs API callbacks. This session will include providing a very quick demo
  of searchlight and a brief architectural review for anybody that would li
 ke to better understand searchlight and to help guide the discussion.* Eth

DESCRIPTION:A subject of much discussion on the ML in recent weeks\, this 
 is an opportunity to discuss the current container integration we have (co
 ntainerized compute that leverages kolla containers)\, and look at the roa
 dmap in terms of what we can deliver for Newton in this area (e.g what is 
 achievable and what integration will avoid regressions to our existing fea
 tures).- Does composable services combined with containers get us closer t
 o benefitting from Heat during updates (ref Zaneb's thread)- What is the m
 ost workable path towards a fully containerized overcloud within the Newto
 n timeframe- Are there ways to improve collaboration betweeen communities\
 , e.g TripleO provisioning combined with Kolla/OSAD/etc for service config
 uration?

 olutions: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/276968/. Personally\, I would l
 ike to see more details  Need more details before voting Like aliyun's MNS
 \, we can support two types of notificaiton content format\, one is simple

 t\, that contain project id\, queue name\, messages and ids\, when subscri

DESCRIPTION:Title: Deprecate pool groupDescription: Now the relationship b

 )\, so we don't really need the pool group. Because for now\, Zaqar only s
 upports two types of message storage\, redis and mongodb. That said\, ther
 e are only two flavors at most\, one for redis and one for mongodb. Though
  technically\, operator may create more than one pool group for one storag
 e type\, for example\, user(cloud provider) has 10 mongo instances\, they 
 may put 4 instances into mongo-group-1 and put another 6 into mongo-group-
 2. But unfortunately\, in Zaqar's flavor\, only ONE pool gruop can be set.
  And I would admit\, if we remove pool group and let pool map to flaovr di
 rectly\, it's a little bit weird(though i don't know why it's weird :)

                        This proposal will discuss how to support a key man
 ager on a per project basis. This feature will allow cloud customers to ch
 oose amongst several key managers to choosethe one that best fits their ne
 eds. This will allow customers with highly sensitive data to choose a key 
 manager that meets security requirements such as FIPS 140-2 whilecustomers
  with less senstive data can choose a basic software only implementation.B

 aremetal now supports network-isolation and works without any host-cloud p
 atches - lets discuss how we might use it in more places (dev environments
  via tripleo-quickstart\, CI using standard nodepool devstack images)- Are
  there ways we can reduce the maintenance burden\, e.g more reuse between 
 upstream/RDO CI (in terms of resources and CI implementation) - currently 
 we're burning a ton of developer time keeping our CI running.- Status of t
 he things we've added to CI recently (net-iso\, upgrades\, ipv6\, pingtest
 ) - (how) can we continue to improve coverage (e.g tempest which is a cons
 tant RFE) within the constraints we have ref compute resources and walltim
 e?

 track comprised of collaborative\, working sessions for people who are ope
 rating OpenStack clouds (and contributors who want to hear from them). The
  purpose is to share knowledge and best practices among cloud operators\, 
 as well as provide feedback based on experience running OpenStack. There w
 ill be no formal presentations\, and a moderate level of knowledge around 
 running OpenStack is assumed. If you're just starting out\, the Operations
  Track of the conference will be much more friendly!

DESCRIPTION:Following the success of the same event at the Tokyo summit\, 
 all this is is a place and ops will gather here. Apparently good things wi
 ll happen\, but it's completely unstructured and informal\, so who knows w
 hat will happen! The Ops Meetup\, organized by the User Committee\, is a 
 track comprised of collaborative\, working sessions for people who are ope
 rating OpenStack clouds (and contributors who want to hear from them). The
  purpose is to share knowledge and best practices among cloud operators\, 
 as well as provide feedback based on experience running OpenStack. There w
 ill be no formal presentations\, and a moderate level of knowledge around 
 running OpenStack is assumed. If you're just starting out\, the Operations
  Track of the conference will be much more friendly!
